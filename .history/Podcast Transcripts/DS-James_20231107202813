0:00
i don't want to limit myself i want to think as big and as ambitiously as possible
0:05
and so like the phrase that i like is i want to work backwards for magic what is the magical outcome
0:10
and then let's work backwards from that
0:16
hey it's ryan holiday welcome to another episode of the daily stoke podcast my guest today is actually someone that
0:22
i met i can't even remember now it must have been six or seven years ago i was at a conference and i was talking
0:28
about the process of putting together books i got this question from a guy in the audience he was saying you know
0:35
why would i do a book you know i've got this big email list i write directly to my audience why would i ever traditionally publish a
0:41
book and we talked a little bit about it and and i think i convinced him because he ended up publishing one of
0:48
the best books of the last several years a book that i think about on a regular basis and even if you just think about the
0:54
title it should influence you which is to me a sign of a great book i'm talking about james clear in his book atomic habits atomic having
1:01
a double meaning not just meaning explosive habits but also the the sort of the smallest
1:08
possible size of a habit focusing on the little things that put in forth a chain reaction that
1:13
that can in fact be explosive james is someone uh who has helped change my habits directly
1:19
we're in kind of a mastermind group with a bunch of different authors which i look forward to attending every year
1:24
because accountability is a big part of habits and changes and certainly that's something that's big in stoicism marcus de realis would not be
1:31
who he is without rusticus without his teacher fronto just as epictetus wouldn't have been who he was without musonius rufus
1:38
and on down the line i see james as someone who's a bit of an accountability partner like that for me plus someone who's just doing high
1:45
quality work out in the world that inspires me to try to up my game so please check out atomic habits
1:51
definitely a book worth reading check out his newsletter at jamesclear.com he sends out this sort of
1:56
best of thursday thing that's fantastic and of course does his uh his very famous articles as well which i'm sure you've read
2:02
so here's my interview with the one and only james clear you know originally we were going
2:07
to do this uh in early january but it's actually i think more fitting that we're talking at the end of january because
2:15
it's the it's like i would imagine a good chunk of people that have bought my books and your books
2:21
and started out the year trying to think about new year's resolutions have already quit on them
2:27
and uh like we did this new year new challenge thing for daily stoic and
2:32
and it's 21 days and it's like you know the first the first email it's like 100 open rate then the next one it's like 90
2:39
then 80. and by the end something that people paid for you know they're at like 40 open rates
2:44
after three weeks so it's it's amazing to me how we it's like we start out with really clear intentions
2:50
but we can't we can't follow through yeah it's so common so true i also like you know
2:57
i've had this happen to me many times you know it's not like i'm immune to the to the the phenomenon like we all get
3:03
excited and amped up about things early on and then it comes time to execute and life happens and
3:10
things like you know taper off this is what you're kind of getting at though this whole discussion about new year's resolutions
3:16
this is one of the central things i talk about in atomic habits is this idea of like starting with identity rather than results
3:21
and i do think there's something to that that like at the beginning of the year people are very excited about the results they can
3:28
imagine for themselves losing weight or making more money or you know meditating every day or
3:33
whatever um but they still don't see themselves in that way they don't consider
3:38
themselves to be a meditator or a writer or an athlete or whatever the type of person who doesn't miss
3:44
workouts and so i usually encourage people start there like start with the the identity that you want to have or
3:50
start with the lifestyle that you want to live and then start doing small habits that reinforce that
3:55
identity rather than just being like oh i'm going to lose 40 pounds and then when that doesn't happen in three weeks you inevitably feel you
4:01
know demotivated well that's something that they talk a lot about in sports so people have heard about it a thousand times and we pay lip
4:07
service to it but then in our own lives we don't actually follow it which is a new year's resolution the problem with that is that
4:13
you are focusing you are starting with the result i want to lose 40 pounds i want to learn i want to know spanish
4:21
you know like you're picking a thing and you're saying i want to get that result when really what you're talking about
4:26
identity you're also talking about process it should be i want to i want to eat
4:32
better meals on a daily basis as opposed to i want to get a certain thing or i want to write a book is is not the
4:39
right goal it should be i'm i'm going to start writing like you know it's the doing the thing versus
4:45
focusing on the outcome well and this is kind of one of the i don't know discoveries i had as i was working on
4:51
the book and writing about the topic more is that when you stick to the process like you're saying right now when you like
4:56
perform habits consistently every action you take is like a vote for the type of person you want to become
5:02
and so by doing those habits you're casting these little votes for the type of person that you are the
5:07
identity that you believe you have you're sort of reinforcing that internal narrative and so
5:13
by building small habits by sticking to the process you are in that moment reinforcing that
5:20
identity and ultimately once you get to that point where you say hey actually you know i've done this enough times i think
5:26
this is part of my story like i am a basketball player or i am a meditator or i am a writer or whatever it is
5:31
um you're no longer pursuing behavior change at that point because you're already you're not trying
5:38
to be someone new you're just acting in alignment with the type of person you see yourself to be
5:43
and you know like take you know you're a great example of this as uh say someone who has the identity of a writer or an
5:48
author now that doesn't necessarily mean the task of writing is easy for you or that it doesn't require any effort
5:55
but the act of writing every day is in alignment with how you view yourself the the internal narrative of
6:01
i'm an author or i'm a writer you're not like trying to convince yourself or in the case of many habits or new year's resolutions people say
6:07
things like i need to get motivated or i need to get amped up or like i need the willpower to do it and like
6:12
you don't necessarily need to get motivated to be a writer you already view yourself in that way
6:18
now you still need to stick to the habit you still need to do the work but i think it's the the work takes on a different characteristic at that point once you
6:25
start to identify as the type of person who does that consistently and it's it's sort of paradoxical so i get why it's it's hard for people to
6:31
understand like you you hear bill belichick or someone talk about the process and you're like but you've won the most
6:37
games out of anyone or or in zen in the art of archery you know he talks about you know put the target out of your mind
6:43
you know what's the point of archery if you're not aiming at the target right so it it
6:48
feels insane and that's probably why people have resistance to it and i i think where i've come down is like
6:54
okay obviously having goals is better than someone who has no goals but then it's like once you have the
7:00
goal philosophically you get to a place where the goal becomes not important so it's it's a weird
7:06
contradiction that you're asking people to wrap their heads around well and i kind of feel like if you really care about the goal you'll focus
7:13
on the system you know like if you if you actually care about getting the result which supposedly is what we all are
7:18
doing this for the archer is trying to hit the bullseye the football players trying to win the championship and so on supposedly
7:25
results matter so much we care so much about them and this is coming by the way from someone who is
7:30
very results-oriented like i've kind of had to you know like do therapy on myself or whatever to get
7:35
myself to focus on the process more and not be so hung up on the outcome but if you do care about the outcome so
7:41
much then you need to focus on the system in the process because that's how you actually achieve it and furthermore being outcome focused
7:49
will help you achieve a goal one time but if you want to keep winning again and again you have to be focused on the system and
7:55
so goals are good for uh one-time wins systems are for people who want to win
8:01
repeatedly and i feel like that's kind of where i um how i think about the distinction between the two
8:06
yeah what's that what's that joke where it's like uh once you're lucky twice you you have good systems
8:11
you know or twice you're good you know it's like doing it once is easy or it can be random but if you're trying
8:17
to replicate it there needs to be some sort of process right and i i'd be curious too as an
8:22
author like again this because the sports thing is you have you want your book to be successful no one writes a book and then
8:28
they hope nobody reads it but then there they also the place this this uh process comes in mark surrealist
8:34
talks about this he goes like sanity is tying your happiness to your own actions you know like if your goal on your book
8:42
it like you can't really have a system that guarantees you too much of the external results like
8:48
you can't have a system that is going to make your book a number one new york times seller you can have a system that should
8:54
generate a good book you know like you can have the system to focus on the parts that are in your control
8:59
and then you also have to get to a place where you write off the parts that are not in your control as being much less consequential
9:08
yeah i kind of think about it like you have things that you don't control at all the weather for example then you have
9:14
things that you influence but you don't control them you know like if you're playing someone in tennis you can influence the outcome you can't
9:20
control how they play or where they should hit their shots or whatever and then you have things that you're like fully under
9:26
your control you know what you choose to wear today or whatever and most of the things that really matter in
9:33
life fall in the middle category you can influence them but you can't totally control them
9:38
and so at some point at least for myself like with writing atomic habits i had to kind of be at peace with
9:45
the effort that i put in or something like i didn't want to get to the end of it you know depending on how you measure
9:50
it it took somewhere between three to five years to finish the book your whole life i didn't want to get to
9:55
the end of that process and feel like i hadn't given the best effort i could um now i hoped it would do well and hit
10:03
a best sellers list and sell a bunch of copies and all that but i can't control that but i just wanted to feel like i had
10:09
influenced every bit of that process that i could and then you know then we'll see what happens and um
10:16
you know there's always something more you could have done but i'm at peace with the effort i gave you know
10:21
and i feel like that's uh that was probably the most important thing for me and then the fact that has worked out
10:27
well you know just makes it all feel much better afterward yeah that's that's the extra but i mean imagine if you'd gotten
10:34
the results but you knew that it wasn't as good like you know like that's that's a weird position to
10:40
be in that i've been in at different times in my life and i'm sure you've seen it with articles or something where you did a pretty good job but it wasn't
10:47
like your best yeah there's a there's a weirdness to it i mean you still enjoy it there's something about
10:53
the um there's something about the struggle that makes the outcome more uh you know enjoyable like
11:00
i think about imagine if you had spent your whole career you played football as a kid and through high school and college and
11:06
you're finally like the kicker on the super bowl winning team and you kicked the field goal to win the game
11:11
and how that would feel after spending 25 years of your life dedicated toward that that goal
11:17
versus being like a professional soccer player and then you retire and you're like hey you know what i might try out
11:22
for a team and then you turns out you can be the kicker and then the starter gets hurt and you end up kicking the game-winning field
11:27
goal in the super bowl and it's like it would still be really cool but i don't know that it would be
11:32
the same because you don't have the struggle before it and so there needs to be some kind of
11:38
yeah the height of your joy is tied to the depth of your sorrow in that sense and the more that you the more effort
11:43
that you put in the the better it feels when you do have some success there's a there's a story i just found and you
11:49
can't steal it because it's going to be in my next book but um uh jimmy carter was a was a nuclear
11:55
engineer before he was a a a a politician and before i guess before he was a peanut farmer but
12:01
he he he went to the naval academy and uh he was sort of up for this promotion as
12:06
a naval officer and he was he was interviewed by admiral rickover who single-handedly basically invents the
12:12
idea of a nuclear submarine and anyways he's in this he's in this long interview and these are these notoriously like insane interviews
12:20
um he was like a really difficult guy to please and so he's asking jimmy carter about
12:25
all his accomplishments and goes you know uh you know how did you how did you do in your class at
12:30
uh at the naval academy and he says oh i was 59th in my class of 400 which is extremely difficult he said how
12:37
did you do on this posting and he goes through and he's like sort of beaming listing all his accomplishments
12:42
and um rick over looks at him and he just goes did you always do your best and
12:49
he was like he was going to be like yes you know look at all my accomplishments and then and then he he thought about it
12:56
and he said no i i didn't always do my best and then uh rickover just got up and
13:01
left the room and he jimmy carter said the rest of his life was trying to provide a better
13:07
answer to that question and so it was interesting to me to go like he'd had this incredible career as
13:12
one of the top people in the navy top of his class but as soon as he had to look at it from the side of
13:18
like was it actually the best he was capable of doing the accomplishment became totally meaningless and i think that's a good
13:25
that's a good microcosm of life yeah that's fantastic that's a yeah it's a wonderful example of
13:30
this idea and it also encourages you to measure outcomes in a different way you know
13:37
like we spend so much time measuring outcomes on how they are relative to everyone else
13:42
you know how much money am i making relative to the person next to me or what is the number on the scale relative to the other people and you know on the
13:48
team or in my class or whatever all these other things that are like status symbols of some sort
13:53
and this is like an internal measure which is um also interestingly both of those are
14:00
about feelings one is about how you feel compared to others and one is about how you feel with like
14:06
your self-esteem and reputation with yourself and um i don't know there's i think there's probably a strong encouragement
14:12
to measure it more in the second way than the first well it's funny because both our mutual friend mark manson and i use this the
14:18
story of dave mustain in in our i did an ego's the enemy and he did it in uh the subtle art
14:24
but you know here's this guy he gets he he's the lead guitarist and founder of mega death that seems like a great
14:29
accomplishment but in light of the fact that he was kicked out of metallica that's a not an accomplishment um and it's like
14:37
so many people would kill to have sold the amount of books that you've sold but then you so you can and if i told
14:43
you at the beginning of your book this is what you're going to have you'd be like that's an unmitigated success but you can still
14:50
but but that's the problem with comparison and and focusing on things that are outside your control is you can
14:55
immediately render your own accomplishment meaningless by by looking at someone who sold one more
15:01
than you and that's like the shitty thing we do to ourselves i don't know why we do that you know like i fall into that just as much as
15:07
everybody else you could get like whatever your current level of output is or successes that becomes your new
15:13
baseline and then you just look at whoever is slightly above that and then you you feel the way you did before and it's
15:20
like you need to remind yourself when you wanted what you currently have you know like there are so many things
15:26
about my current lifestyle that i've spent the last decade working toward and like i thought that was the thing i
15:31
really wanted you know and then you get to hear and uh you feel differently so i don't
15:36
know i um there's some kind of recalibration that goes on there there's some kind of encouraging uh type
15:42
of encouragement that we all need to like focus on those good bits that we have earned already
15:48
rather than uh looking always looking toward the next milestone and i think this also connects back to
15:54
what we were talking about a minute ago with process versus goals or systems versus outcomes
15:59
which is that this is one of the downsides of being goal oriented is that you're always looking at the next
16:04
milestone versus being process oriented or system oriented which is you know i can feel really good about
16:10
myself right now because i got two good hours of writing in this morning and that was an accomplishment and it
16:15
felt like a good day already you know like the day has already been a victory i don't need to like be thinking about all these other huge goals and then
16:21
all of a sudden turn it into a failure well it's very clear why we do it right like evolutionarily
16:26
it makes total sense why we would never be happy with what we've accomplished and then you have to ask yourself what
16:32
am i optimizing for am i optimizing for for evolutionary gains or am i opting for contentment and happiness
16:39
and you're right i think like for me like uh one of the weird parts about being a writer is that
16:44
suddenly you have less and less time to do the thing that you actually like doing and so you have to you have to figure
16:50
out what makes you happy is what make if you're a goal-oriented writer chances are you're only going to have fleeting
16:56
moments of happiness when you hit the best-selling list or you sign the deal or you sell the thing or you get recognized
17:02
or do you want the day in and day out happiness of like actually enjoying the thing and then
17:07
that comes back to which one is more likely which one you have the most control over
17:12
and uh which one is actually easiest to sustain over time
17:17
yeah you have this weird phenomenon where success kind of eats itself it's like the better you get at
17:23
something the more opportunities come your way and the more opportunities come your way the more likely you are to get
17:28
distracted from doing the thing that got you those opportunities in the first place and so as you continue to improve
17:35
and find yourself enjoying more results you have to like upgrade your ability to
17:41
say no you know there are all kinds of things that i like have to say no to now that would have been like the coolest thing that had come across my
17:47
desk you know like two or three years ago and that's a very fortunate position to be in but it's been a very hard lesson for
17:54
me to learn i seem to be very dumb and slow at learning it like i keep saying yes to things that i should not
17:59
be saying yes to and what you end up finding yourself in is like you get all these commitments
18:05
that are they sound cool on the surface in the moment so if you're goal oriented you're
18:10
like oh man i got invited this cool conference i get to speak at this thing i get to sign this new deal whatever
18:15
but then you find yourself living a lifestyle that's different than the one that makes you happy you know that day so to your point about
18:22
like are you going to be driven by signing the deal or are you going to be driven by i like the lifestyle of writing each day
18:27
or whatever it is for you and so i think we need to spend more time like the first question to answer
18:33
is what what do i want my days to look like you know like what do i want my normal lifestyle to look like
18:38
and optimize for that and then within that how can i do the coolest stuff possible or the biggest stuff possible
18:44
or whatever um and you can let your ambitious side live there but you don't want to it sounds so obvious when stated plainly
18:52
but you cannot consider yourself to be winning or living a successful life if you hate the lifestyle
18:58
like if it's only about these successful results but you hate the lifestyle that is a failure not a success
19:03
no i've written about this a bunch of times it's design your perfect day and reverse engineer your choices from there
19:09
and the other one is like i've i've it's like what is your definition of success is your definition of success money is
19:16
it fame for me i came to realize that the definition of success for me i think was a very stoic idea
19:21
the definition of success is autonomy how much control do you have over your life so it's weird you end up saying yes to
19:29
things that you think that's autonomy you're choosing but then you're actually choosing to have less control day to day
19:35
by agreeing to do these things so like i've talked about this before like when i look at my calendar like today i'm
19:40
talking to you and one other person and those are the only two things in my calendar um and and so that meant that i had a
19:46
free morning to write it meant uh i leisurely read and ate lunch before i was talking to you
19:53
i can leave the office whenever i want i can spend as much time as i want with my kids like that is so success is on the one
20:00
hand being being able to write and do the thing that i like doing and that's what keeps it all going but but it's also not being controlled
20:07
by anyone or any other thing uh even if those are lucrative or fun opportunities
20:13
yeah there's this yes and no or like we kind of conflate them and put pair them together because we you
20:19
know they seem like these like oh two sides of the same coin or whatever but they're actually very different you know like no
20:25
is a decision you say no to something you move on to the next choice yes is a responsibility as soon as
20:31
you've committed to something you now have to you've like already and also like no is sort of like a form of a credit
20:38
you know like by saying no to something you have retained this block of time in the future that you can redeem for whatever
20:44
you want to spend it on and yes is like some form of a debt you know and so like by saying yes to
20:51
like you know this this talk is a good example like by saying yes to this i put myself on the hook for how i was
20:57
gonna spend this hour and once i committed to that one way of spending it i had to do it that way i couldn't spend
21:02
it in any other way i can't be writing the book right now or playing with my kids or walking around the you know forest or whatever
21:08
and so um i like to i j again i'm terrible at doing this and
21:13
figuring out how to say no better so i keep coming up with these ways of trying to remind myself that like yes is a commitment
21:19
no is the choice and as much as possible you want to kind of accumulate those credits that you can
21:25
just spend your future time however you want rather than accumulating debts that you're on the hook to spend in a certain
21:30
way hey everyone it's ryan i've raved about athletic greens before with all the things we've all got
21:38
going on trying to to work stay healthy stay strong work out it's hard to get the right mix

travel packs today well i think about yes and no as as also the opposites of each other so each
23:29
time you say no to something you're saying yes to something else and each time you're saying yes to something you're saying no to something
23:34
else and if you can sit down and do some analysis like where like where does this bill come due
23:41
so i found like um okay if i say yes to stuff who who is that taking time away from right
23:48
it's not taking away time from eating i still managed to go to the bathroom during the day i still seem to find
23:54
time to watch television it's like who ends up cashing this check or you know and what account does it come out of and
24:01
i think unfortunately it almost always comes out of the spouse account or the children account
24:06
and and then you have to ask yourself are you really getting that return so i think for instance i'm glad you did this with
24:13
me but i've said i've scaled almost to zero the amount of podcasts that i agree to be
24:18
on because an hour is an hour and you can't do anything else as you said and and also
24:25
the and you talk a lot about this in atomic habits which i love is the way that different habits and decisions ripple out into other things
24:31
so i find because i don't schedule stuff now like let's say i agreed to do this
24:36
conference call that could have been an email that honestly i shouldn't have been involved with the beginning now it now is a 30-minute conference
24:42
call at 2 30 p.m let's say now my whole day from the beginning it begins with the recognition
24:49
and the acknowledgement that i have to do a thing at 2 30 and now the entire center of gravity of
24:56
what should be a day that's mine is pivoting around this thing that i don't want to do to begin with yeah not only you're
25:02
spending the 30 minutes on it you're also planning the rest of your day around it yeah right i think it's even deeper than
25:08
what you said too about like the opposite or you know like when you say yes something you're saying no to something else
25:13
even more so when you say yes to something you're saying no to everything else for that time slot and
25:19
when you say no to something you are saying um yes to the option
25:24
for pretty much anything else so like one is retaining multiple pathways and the other one is
25:30
closing every other pathway right so there's yeah the i think the
25:35
the punch line here is the more the value of saying no is higher than probably we appreciate and uh hopefully i can get better at it
25:42
well because what you're saying yes to is also the least um
25:47
what's the word it's it's you're saying yes with the and you're paying the highest price so like when you it you do buy something or you
25:55
don't buy something with money it's one thing but when you say yes and then you pay with time you never get that time back and it's
26:02
interesting seneca talks about how how intensely protective we are of money and property and then time
26:10
which is the most rare of all the things we're willing to be like well i don't
26:15
want like if someone's like can i have ten dollars you'd be like can can i give you ten dollars i don't know yes or no but if someone's like can i
26:20
have ten minutes of your time you're like it's only 10 minutes and which is such a re i don't it's
26:25
it's so insane that it almost defies explanation that we would be so casual
26:33
with the one thing that we'll never get back it is crazy and like i said i'm still
26:38
learning this lesson myself but um the other wild thing is that
26:44
by the way you choose to invest your time determines all the other resources anyway
26:49
so you can if you're like oh it's you know just a little bit time i'd rather like i'll use this time to you know get
26:54
some money or whatever like you can just figure out how to get all that stuff that you protect so dearly
27:00
um just by spending your time in a better way so it's it's the one thing that you have to
27:05
optimize above all the others well that leads me to something i was going to ask you so so obviously you think a lot about systems you think a
27:12
lot about process a lot about habits and then the pandemic comes along and it's the largest
27:17
that i've called it this before like the the largest forced lifestyle experiment in human history it just blows up
27:22
everything we thought about how you have to do this job or that job how you have to wake up and live this life or that
27:28
life how has how have your habits and systems changed uh
27:34
with i first i want to know about that pandemic then i have another version of this question but how has your life changed
27:39
in the last 12 months given what's happened well atomic habits came out in october
27:46
of 2018. so for the like year and a half after that i was running it pretty hard um i had
27:53
been traveling more than i ever had before and i think the year after the book came out i spent like
27:59
i added it up it was something like 42 percent of nights in a bed that wasn't my own you know it was like just
28:04
it was just way too much time on the road and um i love travel but that was like
28:09
definitely my ceiling and uh so i still had all these cool opportunities and things coming my way
28:16
and you know a bunch of you know whatever speaking requests and different things like booked when the pandemic hit and so all that
28:21
stuff of course got cancelled and moved virtual and so on and um i was planning on slowing down or
28:28
tapering it back but i never would have slowed down to the degree that i was forced to and i never would have done it
28:33
for as long as i've been forced to and it has been a really great thing um
28:39
it's been exactly what i needed was to stop like running so hard and
28:45
to get back into like a more patterned daily lifestyle you know this is something my readers
28:51
have talked about a lot and that i've talked about it you know speeches and so on is like how do you build habits when
28:57
travel is a big part of your lifestyle or when you're always switching context and there are things you can do but the
29:03
punch line is yeah it is harder you know habits are behaviors that are tied to a particular context you know your
29:10
living room at am is where you meditate or your you know kitchen at 3 p.m is where you
29:15
do the bills or whatever like things get any kind of habitual action tends to get tied to the context it happens in
29:22
so if you're always switching contacts uh you're always changing habits so i guess the answer to your question
29:27
is for the year uh prior to the pandemic my habits were
29:33
basically in maintenance mode like ideally i work out four times a week
29:38
the that year i was working out about two times per week on average because i was just i wasn't home as much and it was like it was enough for me to tread
29:44
water and so in the years since the pandemic um things have been better for me on the
29:49
habit front because my day and lifestyle has been so scheduled and i've been in the same place every time so
29:55
in that sense it's been easier yeah it's sort of if when you travel or you're busy or you
30:00
have sort of the unpredictability of life you always have an excuse right so i i felt like it's like i write
30:06
every day but when i'm traveling maybe i'm only 70 effective this is something i realize
30:12
when i'm traveling it's like if you try if you're let's say you know you're when you travel or you're not in your
30:19
normal routine you're 70 as good as what you're doing that means that basically every three days it's the
30:25
equivalent of taking a day off right and so uh it was occurring to me i
30:31
was writing every day but i was i was like gutting it out i was doing my habits like
30:36
white knuckling it and then i i did think there was i i knew there was some cost but i was
30:42
massively underestimating the cost of creativity happiness exercise diet etc that as soon as
30:49
i was in one place i was i was getting the full results so i was like you probably
30:54
you're like well what happens to this income what happens to all these things if if you're suddenly in one
31:00
place and the answer is it's like if you lose your sense of taste your sense of smell gets better like it
31:07
actually it just corresponding adjustments and you may actually end up in a better spot
31:13
yeah i um workouts are a good example for me with that like if i'm at home i train you know with weights in a gym a
31:20
squat rack and all that you know i got this equipment if i'm on the road then i'm doing a lot of bodyweight workouts in hotel rooms
31:27
and you know like just doing things in a sub-optimal way and so yeah all those 70 days you know i i
31:34
think uh simultaneously two things are true here one is that i'm still glad that i did those
31:40
workouts because like we were talking about earlier it casted a vote for being the kind of person who didn't miss workouts and
31:45
reinforce the identity and all that stuff and so in that sense sometimes the bad days are even more
31:51
important than the good days because you prove to yourself that you can show up even when it's not ideal
31:56
and yet the other side is also simultaneously true which is if the bad days become your normal day
32:02
and you just keep throwing up 70 over and over again then that actually is a very high cost over the course of
32:07
six months or a year or so on something needs to change right no that's that's a good point it's a very stoic concept too where
32:14
um look it's easy to be disciplined and and this is the point it's easy to be disciplined it's easy to be on top of it
32:20
it's easy to be consistent when you are living in what we're currently living in which is a literal
32:26
bubble like you can't go anywhere no one can come over you're not supposed to do anything every day is exactly the same and the
32:32
unpredictability has gone way way way down and that and and i think about that as someone who's into habits and
32:38
into routines is is these these things can almost they almost become like a level of ocd-ness
32:44
where where you almost become fragile and you're not able to deal with life so so to be able to have good habits and
32:50
good systems while you travel while your wildlife is crazy is actually really good practice and and
32:57
you don't you don't want to be someone who can only like you can only eat well work out when
33:02
you have a personal chef and a trainer and you're you know renting a house on the beach like of
33:09
course everyone can be good there can you you can stay sober in prison because you can't get access to stuff
33:14
what happens when you're in the real world now you need some resiliency too yeah i actually have a passage from the
33:20
daodejing and atomic habits that says something of like the way of life is to be supple and you
33:25
know flexible the way of death is to be brittle and hard and so like the flexible prevail and you
33:31
need to have some element of that in your both your mindset and just your ability to adapt to different situations
33:37
but then when you're i kind of uh daria rose has a good concept that she calls uh home court habits and away court
33:43
habits when you're at home you're on your own court you can design it and optimize it for you like let's make that as optimal as possible reduce
33:50
distractions give you exactly what you need to perform at the highest level possible when you're on your the away court when
33:55
you're traveling around or whatever you need to be flexible and you know able to make something happen even if it's suboptimal
34:01
yeah i talked about russell westbrook and stillness like he's this guy has insane habits routines rituals
34:07
and then he gets traded twice in two years you know how do you you know he had like a parking spot he had a chapel he had like
34:14
a trainer who made him the same thing every day and and that was great when he spent the vast majority
34:20
of his career on one team where he was the top guy and then life throws you a couple of
34:25
curveballs that's where you backslide and not that he did but you know what i mean you have to be able to absorb
34:32
the uncertainty and the changes or or you're just very fragile a little detail to add to that i always
34:37
thought this was a good example um in the art of learning josh waitzkin talks about how he took his
34:42
um so he competitive chess player also competitive martial arts martial artist and for his martial arts
34:48
performances and competitions before he would go out he had like a little ritual that he did and you know a lot of athletes had this kind of
34:54
pre-game routine or whatever and gradually over the course of a few years he started paring it down and
34:59
compressing it making it smaller and smaller until he got it down to where it was just like 30 seconds or so
35:05
and it ended up serving him really well because he was at an international competition and he either was given the wrong
35:11
information or misread the schedule or whatever and he was taking a nap on one of the benches and they were like hey you're
35:16
supposed to wrestle in like three minutes and he woke up like groggy and kind of like goes through his 30-second routine
35:23
and he was ready to compete and um i've tried to develop something kind of like that with writing where
35:29
you know if i'm at home i face a wall that doesn't have any windows i put on my headphones i listen to the
35:34
same playlist every time i grab a glass of water like i try to set up the environment the optimal way
35:39
but the one thing that i have to do is i have to put my headphones on i have to play the same playlist every time in the
35:45
same order and i can do that basically anywhere i do when i'm on a plane i do it in a hotel room
35:51
and by compressing it down to something that's really short like that i make it easier for myself to like get
35:57
into the state of flow and perform at a high level even if things aren't optimal and so it's nice to be able to not rely
36:04
you know i think about like the what russell westbrook example i don't know what his routine is but i'm like man if you have to go to the same chapel
36:10
and park in the same parking lot and do all you've got to do all that stuff it's actually kind of brittle and so you need to be able to have like
36:16
something that you can carry with you and utilize that to get into your flow state or get ready to go
36:21
and then that leads me to my next question which is i know you became a father and that sort of blows up your whole
36:26
life right it just blows up your life in ways you can't possibly imagine
36:32
and so i'm curious how how have you kept those systems or routines or what have you learned about habits and routines that maybe you
36:38
weren't thinking about when you're writing this book as as uh what's there's that there's that
36:43
expression there's like an acronym that's like a dual income no kids a dinks i think is what it is where
36:49
you're just like you're just living the life you know and uh it's easy to be an artist or creative person or have good
36:55
systems when you're only responsible for yourself yeah i just didn't try um i took uh i
37:03
took three months off and that was a huge huge benefit you know just to be able to spend that time um
37:10
there have been a lot of lessons but i would say probably the two that come to mind immediately the first is for me i've had to change
37:16
the way that i write books uh when i wrote atomic habits i did it you know i didn't have kids it was kind
37:21
of like this all-consuming project i did it at all hours it was like the thing that i thought about all day i went to bed i dreamt
37:28
about it i woke up i worked on it more like there was it was just this kind of all-consuming project and it's not possible for me to
37:34
operate that way right now as a as a parent and so um i've changed to i just make sure that
37:42
i have two sacred hours every morning where i do my writing and um so first it's the first thing i
37:49
do in the morning like i wake up take a shower get a glass of water and then i do that so i try to fit it in before everybody
37:56
else's agenda like creeps into my agenda um secondly i do that whole ritual that
38:02
i just mentioned a minute ago about like you know putting on my headphones listening to music etc and the idea is by not facing
38:08
windows i reduce like just visual distractions by putting on headphones i reduce auditory distractions
38:14
and i want to just like live in the document basically for those two hours and finally i picked a length of time
38:21
two hours which is long enough for me to actually get into the work and actually get something done
38:26
because you kind of have this startup cost with any creative work but short enough that i finish the
38:31
session and i feel energized good and i can go to sleep and
38:36
wake up again and i know that i can do it tomorrow so in other words i'm not trying to do like six hours of writing because then
38:42
like i don't know if i could actually do that again the next day it's also a reasonable amount of time to ask for right so
38:48
and for i would point that out because lots of people who are thinking about doing their first book or thinking about some project or like
38:54
i i can't dedicate myself totally to do something but it's like it's it's not impossible
39:00
to carve out two hours that's waking up an hour earlier and you know staying up an hour later let's say or
39:06
that's hiring a help for two hours or that's just asking your spouse or your partner to take over for two hours it's not you
39:13
know what you think goes into being an nfl player so it's not as insane as you
39:19
think it is yeah and you know that's just what works for me like people can find whatever is sustainable for them but that was the
39:26
the frame i had was like what can i actually sustain and you know atomic habits was easily
39:32
the longest project i had ever worked on um and when you get on the other side of a really big project like that you
39:38
realize that you can do these big things um but you do have to show up every day
39:45
and so i knew that that was something that i could sustain and would actually show up and that i just need to be patient and like but
39:50
i know that the project will finish itself at some point and i will say that is probably there are
39:57
many things you know people like to criticize books as not being a great business model or whatever i actually love books and think they're an amazing
40:03
business model um but all of the great things that books can
40:09
provide there is one massive trade-off which is that all of the work is up front
40:14
you have to do the reading the research the writing prepare the marketing plan record a
40:20
bunch of interviews you have to do all of that before you've even seen the single copy
40:25
before you sing i've sold even a single copy everything is all that work is stacked up front it's all delayed gratification
40:31
but if you can do all of that then the outcome can be really really great um but many people most people possibly
40:38
don't have the patience for that and the other really challenging part of it is that
40:43
like today i showed up and i worked for two hours and i have this huge manuscript and it
40:48
was a mess when i started and it's still a mess right now and then you need to wake up again tomorrow and do the same
40:54
thing again and this process of showing up every day for two or three or four years and working
41:01
on something that feels like a mess 96 of the time that is a that can be a draining thing
41:08
if you're not in the right mindset and so you just i think you really have to scale down and focus on the process and just getting a couple good hours in
41:14
each day no that strikes me as something that's sort of very endemic to your mindset there's this uh there's this quote from
41:21
epictetus where he says uh first you know decide who you want to be and then do
41:26
what you need to do but i i would say that james the james clear tweak on that formula
41:32
is decide who you want to be do what you want to do and then it's like start with the absolute smallest unit of measurement
41:40
on that thing which is obviously the double meaning of atomic habits but but your point of like okay this two
41:46
year or six year or ten year project i'm going to measure in two hour increments on a daily basis
41:53
and that's how you get to the final product you know i've actually been thinking
41:58
more about this which is i feel like my style and something that i i guess i'll recommend it just because it works for
42:04
me i don't know if it'll work for everybody but find it a bit more ineffably it gives you the flexibility
42:10
if you actually care about those things which i think goes to your point earlier you have to truly love the thing yeah or or else you're
42:17
going to end up making compromises to make it easier you're you want to be able to find out
42:22
what is the best combination of your things given the constraints and the reality of
42:28
what you're talking about i recommended this book a couple times but there's a new victor frankel book
42:33
um you wouldn't think there would he they found this like lost series of lectures but i read and i loved it and he was talking
42:39
about like obviously he wanted to be like the greatest psychologist of his generation he wanted to be great at it
42:45
he didn't think that that would have you know uh detours through the holocaust right and losing his entire family and
42:52
and all the horror that he went through in his life but that's what life does it it blows up your plans
42:58
and then so he's talking about how you have to you have to find out what you were meant to do
43:03
within the co the guard rails of of the stuff that's happened to you um this is um
43:11
circling or we're kind of like hinting or dancing around what i feel like is a really important point which is that
43:18
if you pick any specific domain so let's take your example of become the best-selling author of your generation
43:23
if you pick that what's really tough about this and this is particularly true for anyone who considers themselves to be an
43:30
ambitious person or you know to be uh driven we live in a world of
43:35
seven billion plus people and when there are seven billion people you're going to find a few who are
43:41
willing to sacrifice every other area of their life to work on that one thing whatever that
43:46
particular thing is in your domain and so this is challenging because if you're the type of person who is like
43:53
i'm really ambitious actually i it doesn't excite me to be like well i'll just operate at the 80th percentile like
43:59
i'll just dial it back a little bit actually you're like shooting for you know the 98th percentile or whatever
44:04
well what you end up realizing or coming to discover is that you have to end up playing your
44:12
own game you know like you have to end up defining your own rules sort of the way that you did a minute ago where you said
44:17
oh you know i want to be a great author and a great husband and you know like you have multiple aspects that end up defining
44:24
what success is for you and you can be all of those things but you just need to define it in a way that
44:30
aligns with your particular values and i think this starts to come back to
44:36
a lot of goals and status metrics and things that we end up spending our lives shooting for
44:41
are actually not your goals even though you set them they were inherited from something else they were mimicked
44:47
from society or copied from you know the celebrities the people around you or whatever people that seem seem to have what you want
44:54
but the real work is to become self-aware and to ask yourself questions and re
44:59
revisit those questions again and again around what is important to me what are my values what does my ideal day look like
45:06
what do i actually care about who am i when i'm my best self and when you start to answer those questions and have
45:12
a more clear answer to what is it do i that i really want
45:18
um then you can define your own game rather than getting trapped into some of these things where you know you end up competing with
45:23
people who are actually playing a different game than you but you just didn't realize it well the game the game is rigged right
45:29
let's say you want to hit the most home runs in the history of baseball and you find out oh certain people are willing to cheat to accomplish that same
45:36
goal and so now your your ethics and the the goal are in conflict with each other this is
45:42
why i think meditations is such a fascinating book you have marcus ruiz the most he he gets there he becomes the most
45:47
powerful man in the world the thing that you know a handful of people have ever done and he just sort of immediately
45:52
realizes that it's not it's not that great and it's just a job like anything else and that that you know it wasn't
45:58
it actually wasn't that fun to be alexander the great or julius caesar or any of these things
46:03
and and so that's the problem is yeah you're in competition with people who for whatever reason
46:09
maybe they had a crappy childhood maybe something in their brain broke um maybe they're a sociopath or a
46:15
psychopath who is who is who is not operating on it's like you're you're you as a as a somewhat healthy
46:22
person are subject to gravity and the realities of of happiness and meaning and you're in
46:28
competition with someone who's not moored by those things and you're now going to deprive
46:33
yourself of happiness because they have one more or 10 million more than you you know
46:40
you're you're never you're you're selling out the happiness and
46:45
contentment and peace you could have now to get this thing that's actually an illusion that the other person's not
46:52
even enjoying even if even if it exists which kind of circles back to a point you made early on which is
46:58
how can we have these internal measures of success rather than external because all of the stuff that we're kind of mentioning here
47:04
is related to measuring yourself relative to someone else and if instead we can shift back to am i
47:11
at peace with the effort i gave you know do i feel like i'm uh you know exerting myself and
47:16
or influencing the situation in the way that is satisfying to me then you don't have to worry about the
47:22
other stuff yeah like did did you do your best and i think and because the reality is you'll fail
47:27
so so that's what i think is interesting to pull this back to jimmy carter most people think jimmy carter wasn't a
47:33
good president and i i'm i'm still reading a lot about him so i i don't want to make a judgment but let's say he what let's say universally we all agree
47:40
he's not a good president well it's a really hard job and maybe he like the only way you can walk away from
47:47
failing at that level not just failing but failing in public
47:53
many people think he just sucks and can how do you walk away from a book failing or a president's
47:59
uh presidency failing or or a goal uh you know you wanted to lose 30 pounds by
48:04
march and you know you you only lost 19 and and you you're mad at yourself how
48:11
do you how do you carry on you have to know that you gave your best that's the like that's the only way
48:18
what you know what if your book had come out the day of a terrorist attack or my book had come out the day of a
48:24
hurricane and it just all got wiped away and you lost that moment uh and and you just did you
48:30
didn't get it i mean that that happens too that's why i i mean there can be it's
48:36
harder to do it than what i'm about to say but i do think there can be a simple philosophy that you can carry around which is
48:41
just have one good day you know just have one good day and then repeat it like that that's all i really was trying
48:46
to do today you know like did i have two good hours of writing i'll go get a workout in and i'll play with my kids and that that's a good day you know and then
48:53
like i can show up again and i can do it tomorrow and what happens to the project whenever it comes out like
48:58
i will try to influence that as best i can but i can't control it and so instead if it flops i'm just
49:05
gonna wake up tomorrow i'm gonna try to have a good day again did you have you i've talked about this too did you see the movie palm springs
49:12
no i haven't seen it it's so it's so good uh it's it's the perfect movie to watch during quarantine
49:18
but yeah it's realizing like oh i think that's what i've found during the pandemic it sort of radically shrinks uh life as
49:25
well so yeah you're like a good day followed by a good day followed by a good day and they all just blur together and that's really all life is life isn't
49:32
this place that you have to get or these numbers of things that you have to do it's really like
49:38
day to day is it enjoyable and how do you how it's a little more epicurean than
49:44
stoke but sort of how do you get to a place where uh your day to day is good because the
49:49
truth is life is made up of days so why and to go the james clear philosophy
49:54
why not go to the smallest unit of measurement and try to optimize it yep i mean this is the value that
50:01
habits have i think you know like if you can figure out good habits for yourself whether it's writing for two hours or meditating for one minute or doing a
50:07
push-up or whatever then you can start building those into your days and they are likely to become
50:14
better days because of that and uh just by mastering your habits you can end up reaping a lot of long-term
50:20
benefits not only in results and outcomes and success and all of that but also just in happiness or feeling like
50:26
you fulfilled your potential or that you gave your best effort and so on and i don't remember this if this is in
50:32
the book but in the william james thing on habits he talks about like no the the converse of what you just
50:37
said is also true which is that no one he says no one is less happy
50:42
than the person who doesn't have habits who has to make every choice anew right so it's like it you'd think that
50:50
it would be wonderful to be able to do whatever you want every day but the truth is that's
50:55
actually miserable because you're exhausted by all the choices and all the uncertainty and you make the wrong choice a bunch of times
51:02
and so if you know what you want your data is then you're like this is all that i have to do today and i know
51:07
it's manageable there's well there's a scientific argument first of all it's just impossible your brain is automating
51:13
things whether you know it or not you're building habits either way but let's set that aside and just talk about like the choices that you could make and
51:20
kind of william james point about you know like you don't want to have to make each choice anew this
51:25
is one of the like uh i don't know sort of a common criticism but also i think people are just kind of trying to poke
51:31
holes or be snarky sometimes they're like well i don't want to be a robot i don't want to pigeonhole myself for you know like
51:36
have every hour of the day planned or do the same thing every single time or whatever and like first of all just separate from
51:42
that i don't know anybody who actually is like that like i i don't know anyone who actually can live life that way
51:48
because life doesn't work that way every day like introduces other emergencies and things like
51:53
i the idea that you would it kind of reminds me of people were like well i don't know if i want to lift weights because i don't want to get huge like a
51:58
bodybuilder and i'm like it does not happen that fast trust me i've been trying to make it happen that
52:04
fast for like 10 years and it still doesn't work that quickly so cross that bridge when you come to it
52:09
yeah yeah but uh the truth is what you're kind of similar to what you're mentioning habits don't restrict
52:16
freedom they create it you know it's usually the people who have the worst habits that actually have the least amount of
52:22
freedom right it's like the people who have the worst like knowledge and reading and learning habits always feel like they're
52:28
behind the curve people have the worst financial habits always feel like they don't have enough money or they're wondering where the
52:34
next dollar is going to come from people will have the worst health and fitness habits always feel like they don't have enough energy or
52:39
you know they they aren't quite sure how they can they feel exhausted they don't show up and get it all done so it's actually by optimizing your
52:47
habits that you create capacity and space to have that additional autonomy and
52:52
freedom um you know like the fact that i wrote for two hours a day makes me feel really good about my productivity
52:58
and i can move on with the rest of my day i don't have to be working every hour because i know that i already got some
53:03
good stuff done now i can you know spend the rest of the day the way i want it um yeah and so that's true for many many
53:08
things you win early and then the rest is extra right yeah i love it well thanks man i don't want
53:14
to take up more of your time i know we both scheduled an hour so we'll uh we'll give it and then we'll we'll follow our own rules and move on
53:20
to the next thing all right i love it thanks ryan appreciate it dude i appreciate it
53:28
you
