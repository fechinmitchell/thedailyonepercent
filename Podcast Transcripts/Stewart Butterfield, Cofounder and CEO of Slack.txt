[MUSIC]
0:05
>> Hello. >> Stewart, it's a pleasure to have you here today. >> Thank you. >> How are you doing? >> I'm well. >> Cool.
0:11
So typically we would start these with a question, asking the students how many of you use Slack.
0:17
But since it's the official communication platform for the GSP, we're going to have to do something a little different.
0:23
How about a game of two truths and a lie? >> All right. >> Cool. So up here on the screen in just a second, we're going to see three
0:31
statements that I pulled from my extensive research of your past. We're going to ask the audience to guess which one of them is a lie.
0:40
So, statement one, you were born with a name Stewart Butterfield.
0:46
Okay, statement two, you have two philosophy degrees.
0:52
All right? Statement three, Flickr, your first successful startup was conceived while battling with food poisoning.
1:01
Okay, so the audience, raise your hand if you think statement one is false.
1:07
Wow. It's a lot of people. [LAUGH] Raise your hand if you think statement two is false. Okay, raise your hand if you think statement three is false.
1:19
>> [LAUGH] >> Okay, Stewart. >> Feeling pretty good, it's number one. >> It's number one, so you were not born Stewart Butterfield.
1:27
>> I was born Dharma Jeremy Butterfield to hippy parents in a little town called Lund in British, Columbia which is literally the end of the road.
1:35
So Pacific Coast Highway is the same road that goes all the way down to Chile. And then all the way up to where the Fjords of British Columbia,
1:42
and the fact that there's no really, there's no people within any further north means that it was foolish to continue building the road.
1:50
So, born there and grew up in a log cabin for the first couple of years. >> Grew up in a log cabin?
1:56
Abe Lincoln also grew up in a log cabin. >> Very, yeah. >> [LAUGH] >> That's why I bring it up, for the positive associations. >> [LAUGH] Yeah, so trust me, I understand.
2:03
My parents named me Trevorski Tylon Garrett. And as a four-year-old, I was not writing Trevorski on every spelling test.
2:11
So I go by Tylin, and you actually know me by Ty. >> Yeah. >> So- >> T-Y is very creative.
2:17
>> [LAUGH] >> So when I was 12, I really wanted to be normal. And for some reason, I thought Stewart was a normal name, like Mike, or
2:24
something like that. >> [LAUGH] >> And Stewart, it's a pretty bad name. You'll notice this after I say it.
2:30
Any time you watch a movie, TV show, there's a character named Stewart, there's like the jerk version and there's like the sad sack kind of loser version.
2:39
>> [LAUGH] >> Which never a protagonist with the exception of the mouse Stuart Little. >> Stuart Little.
2:44
>> [LAUGH] >> That was one of my favorite movies growing up. So if you could pick any name today, what would it be?
2:49
>> It would be Dharma Jeremy Butterfield, it's a sick name. >> [LAUGH] >> Cool, so
2:54
you hinted a little bit on your parents.
Most lasting influences from parents
3:00
What have been the most lasting influences from their parenting?
3:05
>> That's a good question. I mean, it's hard to separate out
3:11
that from what life would've been without those influences. My mom is incredibly supportive to the extent that when I was 16,
3:20
I got in a car accident, just totaled the car, my dad's car.
3:25
And my mom's reaction was, well, it's really good that you did that, because you learned an important lesson about driving safety.
3:32
[LAUGH] Which is not the reaction I was expecting. My dad was a real estate developer, and real estate development usually works,
3:42
the people incorporating new entity for each project or each development.
3:48
Maybe there's a management company that takes measuring fees but it kind of isolates the investments,
3:53
which means that it's like creating your business over and over again. Like every two or three years, there's a fundraising cycle, and
4:00
there's kind of putting together the vision and a plan. And then over the next decade or so, that plays out.
4:07
So I think that was a big influence for me, just because I got to see the development of, I don't even know.
4:14
Over the course of my childhood, once I was aware of what was going on, maybe five or six different businesses.
4:20
And that was good practice, because I think I started looking at the world that way.
4:25
>> That's cool, that's cool. So you were born Dharma Butterfield.
What led you to learn to program
4:30
You were raised by parents who aspired to live off the land. It only makes sense that you would be drawn to technology.
4:38
So what led you to teach yourself to program at the age of seven?
4:45
>> Computers were just so cool and even like you see now, any three-month or six-month old are just drawn to the iPad in a way that
4:54
seems like it must be indicative of a lower level brain function that was hijacked in order to be attracted to this.
5:00
So for me, many screen, just like any child, any screen was just super attractive.
5:06
But the idea that you could control what appeared was really magical. And it was 1979, 1980, somewhere around there, I got an Apple TV at home.
5:17
So we had one in the classroom. So the very first class at my school to have a computer in the classroom.
5:25
And I would buy a copy of a magazine called Bite which in the back, a couple of pages had programs that you can just type out yourself in an Apple basic.
5:33
And you can change a couple things, and see what happened, and it was really,
5:38
I have difficulty describing like why it had such a powerful hold.
5:44
But what was interesting is if you fast forward like 20 years,
5:49
there was, I had an early getting console called television.
5:55
So like video games, like most boys my age, there are arcades where you went and put quarters in machines and stuff like that.
6:01
But computers themselves became less and less interesting to me over the course of high school but when I got to college, I got an account on the school's Unix machine and discovered the Internet.
6:09
This was 1992, and that was just totally mind expanding.
6:15
And I almost couldn't believe that such a thing was possible, and had like the same feeling of wonder, but to a higher degree.
6:22
Because it was like we as a species, had developed the ability to transcend geography in a much more
6:30
profound way than like long distance phone calls had or the telegraph had. You could find community, I grew up in between College in Victoria,
6:37
British Columbia, which is again on the edge of the continent, very remote, kind of provincial.
6:43
And you could find people who were interested in exactly what you were, anywhere in the world, and that communication was happening at the speed of light.
6:50
So that really opened it up, and then fast forward another ten years.
6:55
So like in the early 2000s, I had this experience finally where I had my laptop with me, and
7:01
at one point in my life had been like the Steve Jobs bicycle for the mind but this incredible machine that anything was possible, and all this amazing software.
7:11
When it wasn't connected to the Internet was inert, was basically kind of useless, it was like a rock.
7:17
So it's a very interesting experience to think about, like the successive layers of what really matters.
7:24
The first one being that ability to run arbitrary code to generate more or less anything that a human can imagine.
7:31
And then the ability to put all of those together. And I think that was like the thing that has guided my career ever since,
7:38
is the exploration of that idea of computing technology as a means of facilitating human interaction.
7:44
>> It's amazing. So, that's what drew you to technology initially, but you actually studied philosophy.
Studying philosophy
7:51
So what inspired that decision? >> I really wanted to do a degree in cognitive science,
7:57
but the school that I went to didn't have cognitive science. So, cognitive science is usually computer science, psychology, linguistics,
8:05
and psychology. And so I wanted to take courses in all four.
8:11
To do an honors degree in Psychology was like every single course was a requirement. In fact, you had to do extra.
8:17
Where as philosophy, it's pretty light set of requirements, even to do an honors degree, so I chose philosophy.
8:22
Literally like that, it was like of those four, the one that had the fewest requirements. But after I started studying it, even though I suck is really a philosophy
8:32
of mine is really interested in neuro psych as an undergrad. The fundamentals of philosophy I found super fascinating and
8:40
this sounds bad and it is bad in one sense and it's good in another sense.
8:46
So you think about the last 2,500 years of kind of the history of inquiry of all different kinds.
8:52
At some point, everyone was a philosopher. If you were interested in the world in
8:58
a religious way like the beginnings of science, philosophy. At some point, mathematics, geometry,
9:06
astronomy split off over the next many hundred years. Things like biology in the 19th century split off into its own discipline and
9:14
psychology, anthropology, sociology, computer science, linguistics, women's studies.
9:20
Until all you had left was an area of inquiry that is not directed at anything except for like itself and language.
9:28
So in one sense, it's really boring. So, if you didn't ever study philosophy, and you pick up a book of contemporary
9:35
Anglo American analytic philosophy, it is super, super boring.
9:41
It's almost impenetrable without this giant vocabulary of ways you're going to get into it.
9:47
But once you're into it, I still find it really fascinating, because there's so many unanswerable questions, yeah.
9:56
>> That's good to know, so who was the most influential philosopher to you?
10:07
>> I have a pretty broad range and I liked all kinds of thinkers but like go back to Aristotle, Spinoza, more contemporary, Klein and Donald Davidson.
10:17
But if there's one, it was Decker because that's why I ended up going to Cambridge.
10:22
>> Amazing, amazing. So we're in 1997 now. You're armed with two philosophy degrees and a name for philosopher, Butterfield.
Back into technology
10:32
But you decided to become a web developer. What led you back into technology?
10:37
>> Well, so like I said, I got to college in 92, which, is like, at least for
10:44
my awareness, six months to maybe a year before the web really took off. I think Mosaic had been invented, but wasn't really widely deployed.
10:52
So the Internet was email, IRC, a Unix program called Talk. More than anything else, it was Usenet.
10:59
And that meant that as soon as the web became a popular medium, that started supplanting things like Gopher and Ways, I was there.
11:08
And it was really, the HTML back then was just dead simple, so very easy to teach ourselves.
11:15
So 93, I was, I don't know, one of five people in my hometown who knew HTML.
11:22
Which meant that 94, 95, 96, every year, my summer job, but also just my job during the school year was making websites for
11:30
people who didn't know how to make websites because pretty much no one did. And it was like 98, I finished my masters and was enrolled in PhD.
11:40
And it was the beginning. So a friend of mine had just finished his PhD in philosophy.
11:47
And went to a great school and did great thesis work and was really at the top of the range and
11:55
got his first job which was at the University of Louisville in Kentucky. And he really did not want to live in Kentucky and it was a crappy
12:00
job with low pay and it is sessional position so it renews every nine months. I thought of how many hoops I had to jump through just to get to that point.
12:09
Or because it was 98, and the .com thing started to take off, and I knew the web, and all of my friends who are early web people were moving to San Francisco and
12:19
getting jobs that paid two or three times as much. And it was exciting and dynamic and were changing the world.
12:24
So I had an advice from a couple of professors over the course of my career who were essentially were this is a terrible life please don't become
12:32
an academic. If you're interested in this stuff, you can subscribe to the journals and attend the conferences.
12:38
>> [LAUGH] >> You don't have to actually do a PhD and then go be a professor. I took that advice.
12:44
>> Okay, [LAUGH] that's good to know. So I'm actually curious, raise your hand if you have a humanities degree.
12:54
Okay, keep your hand raised if you're considering a career in technology.
Advantages and disadvantages of humanities degree
13:01
Okay, so my question there is, what were the advantages and disadvantages in having a humanities degree within the technology industry?
13:13
>> It's tough because there's multiple technology industries. So I would say, when I started in 98, the web was tech, but
13:20
it was populated much more by people with a background in like graphic design or architecture if you're making web development.
13:26
This serious back end programmers had a parallel track to web server development.
13:33
But it was really like a totally different era and there wasn't anything in between the architects and the graphic designers on one side.
13:42
And the people, this won't be a familiar reference to many of you, but the people are using web logic and ATG, Dynamo, and
13:50
these like from today's contemporary perspective, kind of really horrible application servers,
13:58
that had a fundamentally different approach to doing web development. It was stateful applications, things like Enterprise JavaBeans.
14:04
And so I don't think it really made any difference, what your background was, at that point.
14:10
It could have been history could have been finance could have been physics.
14:17
And meanwhile, there's a different technology injury which is like all of the descendants of Fairchild Semiconductor and
14:24
Intel HP and a bunch of companies that were native to this area. But that was completely different.
14:31
Like, the design of circuit boards and processors and manufacturing computers was totally unrelated to the web.
14:38
And still today, I think we say tech industry broadly. I think mostly what people mean is at least around the Bay Area
14:46
is companies that receive EC backing as opposed to anything else. They're not necessarily specifically technology companies.
14:53
And the side effect of software eating the world, in the famous phrase, is that every company's a technology company.
15:02
So you can look at, I don't know, Visa or Mastercard probably employ close to an order of magnitude more software developers than Stripe.
15:13
Everyone would say Stripe as a technology company, is PayPal a financial services company or a tech company?
15:20
Is Airbnb a tech company or a hospitality company? It really becomes increasingly hard to make that distinction,
15:27
unless you mean like technology is Huawei making 5G antenna chips, and it's Dell, and then software businesses, like.
15:37
>> Yeah, thank you for that. So you worked as a web designer for a few years before starting a video game company
Vision for Never Ending
15:43
and launching your first video game, Game Neverending. What was your vision for that game?
15:49
>> So, when you said 92 the thing that was most interesting to me about the Internet was Usenet.
15:54
Usenet is a, those of you who don't know it, a hierarchical directory of newsgroups and it covered more or less everything.
16:01
So, they began with the three letter Abbreviations, so SCI was science, and there was science, physics, and geology, and so on.
16:10
And then Rak, rack.music.gdad, Grateful Dead was, in 92, the Netflix of its time in the sense that it used more
16:19
bandwidth than any other single thing on the Internet. There's so much traffic of people discussing Grateful Dead,
16:29
that it kind of surpass everything else. So 93, I guess, probably a year later, I had
16:37
the first experience of having a crush on someone that I had never actually met, it was just from her online persona, her sig files, the things she said in comments.
16:46
And that the idea that that kind of connection was possible,
16:51
I mean at this really early stage but it's very interesting to me.
16:57
You go forward to 98, 99, 2000, and people had blogs, they were the early social networks like Six Degrees, and then
17:06
Friendster was probably 2002-ish, around there. But people had started kind of developing a persona and having interactions with
17:15
other people over the Internet in a bunch of different virtual communities. Some of those are really explicit,
17:21
like the wells are, like more the ancient ones but bulletin board systems,
17:26
discussion boards moves kind of like interactive chat based games.
17:32
And I mean I said earlier that the idea of social interaction mediated by computing technology like the new
17:40
possibilities that opens up was the thing that is really fascinating to me. So when you say game, I think people have the assumption that there's puzzle games,
17:48
and there's shooting games, and there's sports games, and stuff like that. This was none of those and this was just play as a pretext for social attraction,
17:56
so this is a description that may or may not have appeal to some of you. I will tell you that it does not have broad commercial appeal.
18:03
>> [LAUGH] >> And that's just like a whimsical world of absurdist humor and kind of hopefully,
18:13
delightful little things to discover. But it's mostly like a venue for people to interact into and
18:19
to form community with one another. And super popular among the small group of people from we developed this
18:27
prototype and we're testing it, but that was 2002. So some of you are probably were just little babies in 2002, but
18:35
there was the dot-com crash which started in 2000, there was the WorldCom, and Enron accounting scandals, there was 9/11.
18:43
It was just like a really dark time for financial markets, the Nasdaq was down,
18:48
I think, 80 or 85%, from its peak, so the S&P 500 was down 65%.
18:53
It's kind of hard to imagine, even in comparison to 2008, so no one wanted to invest in Internet stuff period, but
19:00
definitely no one wanted to invest in web based massively multiplayer games, that was just as frivolous as you could possibly be.
19:07
Which meant that no one would invest in us and we didn't have enough money to finish it. And we tried to cast around for something that we could do with the technology that we developed that would
19:16
create a commercially viable product that turned out to be Flickr. >> Yeah, so ironically, Game Neverending did end.
Never Ending Dead End
19:23
>> Yep. >> So [LAUGH] how did you feel when you realized you had to shut down the game?
19:31
>> Horrible, but at the same time, that kind of happened, but we were developing Flickr and the games side-by-side for a couple of months.
19:40
The decision to make Flickr and then its launch, three months, separating those happened pretty quickly.
19:48
But in that case, it felt like it was, there's a path forward, the team got to stay together.
19:54
We had disappointed a lot of people who were playing it, but also a lot of them are like, but cool, Flickr is interesting too and
20:01
they just kind of migrated, so that wasn't that bad. >> It's good, so you realize you have to shut down a game, but
20:08
not before flying to one last video game conference in New York. What happens next?
20:14
>> So it's a conference on law and virtual worlds, and it's in New York, and flew from Vancouver where I was living.
20:20
And got food poisoning on the flight and I don't want to get too vivid, but it's just like puking in the immigration hall at JFK, puking in the cab on the freeway.
20:30
Get to the hotel and step out of the cab and puke all over the carpet, [LAUGH] so it's all right, a little vivid.
20:38
>> [LAUGH] >> I couldn't keep down anything, like ginger ale, water.
20:44
And that night at like 3 in the morning after being up with kind of feverish and
20:50
frantic, wrote out the whole first version of flicker, what it would be and how would take advantage of those technologies.
20:58
I will say this though that was the very first version which was very different than one and
21:04
ended up becoming It was not actually very good That got us got us going. >> So I've am yet to have a battle with food poisoning be so productive.
Focus on Flickr
21:15
So kudos to you there. You decided to focus on flicker When you made that shift,
21:22
did everyone on your team buy in immediately or what was that process like? >> No so I'm pretty democratic leader sometimes.
21:30
[LAUGH] Maybe less so now than back then. But we had a vote and there was a tie and I was like [SOUND] so I called.
21:40
Erik Costello was actually one of the founders of slack as well. And just like this and background lobbying to get him to change his vote, so
21:48
that we could go ahead with it. There's definitely like there's people who are still interested in making
21:56
the game and felt like it was a shame to leave it behind. It was also I think, in terms of the number of people online, way too early and
22:04
the technology that was available way too early. Like I think people forget 2002 was the first year that any country
22:12
that more than 50% internet penetration at home and that was the Netherlands. So, and even then that was almost all dialogue connectivity.
22:19
So most Americans didn't have Internet access. If they did, it wasn't working. It was very kind of narrowly prescribed.
22:25
And if they did anything online, it was like maybe check sports stores and stock prices or something like that.
22:31
So there wasn't really a market for it. But, I just like making software just in the same way that I did
22:39
When I was seven years old and I think everyone else on the team did too, so we just got to make a different kind of software. And in the end it was, the game was, play as a pretext for social interaction.
22:49
Flickr was photography as a pretext for social interaction, is the first, actually one of the, we got bought by Yahoo and
22:56
one of the designers there called it, massively multiplayer photo-sharing. Which I thought was pretty accurate because it was our first Thing,
23:01
other than websites that I heard about later. Where you can put a photo online and people can see it, and comment on it and
23:09
have a title and description and you can tag it and create groups and all that kind of stuff.
23:15
So it was a social network that revolved around photographs. I think we started right around the same time as Facebook,
23:23
when Facebook was still just in Harvard for another six months or a year, and then just Ivys for another close to a year after that.
23:31
>> Cool, so not to spoil the story, but you eventually sell Flickr to Yahoo for excess of $20 million.
Lessons from Flickr
23:39
I'm curious, looking back now as you're leading Slack what lessons from your time at Flickr have been most influential on the leader that you are today?
23:50
>> It's hard to say because it was so long ago. We started development in 2003, launched in 2004, and then
24:00
The summer inside the winter break 2004 2005 there's this big Decision about
24:05
whether we're going to take VC funding or we're going to get bought by Yahoo. So it was 2005 to 2008 and I was there, and
24:11
there's definitely not something that stands out like the thing that I learned there other than how hard it is to get something done or
24:21
how hard it is, I mean me that's that is a good lesson, how hard it is to get something done in an organization of that size.
24:30
Yeah, it was about 12,000 people. And I think there's a couple things that were wrong with it at that time, but
24:36
the biggest one was it had basically stopped growing. And in an environment where the pie isn't growing anymore, suddenly the kind of
24:44
game theoretic, the calculus, especially among executives is very zero sum.
24:50
So it was like people battling each other internally. We even forget that for a second, any company of any organization of 10,000
24:57
people and it requires such an extraordinary injection of a will
25:02
to make anything happen that most things are for all practical purposes impossible.
25:09
>> Okay, so we fast forward to 2012, you have left Yahoo, which by the way,
Slack in 2012
25:15
if you have not read Seward's resignation letter from Yahoo, please Google it.
25:21
He likens himself to attend Smith or named Brad, it's quite hilarious.
25:27
Since 2012, you're starting another video game company this time, Tiny Speck. At Tiny Speck, you launched a game called Glitch,
25:35
what gave you more confidence in the gaming area this time around? >> So it's 2009 that we started the company, and 2012 is when we shut it down.
25:43
But it's the same group of people, [INAUDIBLE] the four of us who had worked at Flicker, and we all worked at Yahoo together.
25:48
But 2002 to 2009 was pretty amazing time in the history of the Internet, and suddenly everyone had Internet access.
25:55
And there were phones that were capable of Internet access, Blackberries and
26:02
Trios, there were a lot of people had high speed Internet by that time.
26:08
The world of open source software specifically to support development on the Internet we had just exploded,
26:15
so there was really not much available in 2002. But by 2009, we had a very robust mature,
26:23
Apache foundation, and all of these great networking technologies, people's computers are much faster, and there's many more people online.
26:30
We were much more experienced, it was very easy to raise money. If you just like look at any factor in a giant matrix of like things that would
26:37
lead this to be a good plan or to be successful. We had shifted from a two out of ten, to an eight, nine or ten out of ten,
26:45
except that that idea was still not very commercially viable. [LAUGH] Same idea, like better graphics.
26:52
>> [LAUGH] >> Do you think that idea is ever going to be commercially viable?
Will Slack ever be commercially viable
26:58
>> Well, I mean, so we could have kept going and paid all of our salaries and been happy, and it would have been interesting but we had taken,
27:07
by that point, $17 million in VC money. So I felt like it would have been an aberration of the responsibility,
27:15
that kind of contract we made with them to just do that, so we had to think of something else.
27:22
>> So you said 17 and a half million, and funding you had around 45 employees around the time?
What was the toughest part about shutting down Slack
27:29
So you find yourself in a familiar situation and you have to shut down that game again,
27:34
what was the toughest part about that decision the second time around? >> So the second time around, it was very different because it wasn't just, hey,
27:43
everyone, we are now as a group and a switch working on because there was
27:48
animators, and musicians, and writers, and illustrators, level designers. A whole bunch of people who just didn't have skills that were transferable to so
27:57
a lot of people were going to get laid off, I think there was 35.
28:02
And in the three and a half years that we had been running the various versions
28:08
of Glitch, there wasn't like pretty strong and very active, robust community. There wasn't like a couple hundred people who tested Game Neverending,
28:17
you could just start using Flickr, they were going to disappear. And I think this is a hard thing to relate to or
28:24
understand if you haven't gone through it, and it's maybe something that hasn't happened in a long time and might not happen again.
28:33
Like Tumblr seems like the last platform that had close communities like that, whereas now, everything, like Instagram is just one world connected, so
28:41
Facebook is another world, Twitter is like everyone. And there are definitely, sub communities. But when communities exist in a one specific platform, and
28:50
that platform disappears, it is a little bit like that moment in the first Star Wars when Alderaan gets blown up.
28:55
Like it is just that society, that little culture, those relationships just will not exist anymore, so it is really like that was very sad.
29:04
But obviously for me, first of all, it is embarrassing, I did all this press and
29:09
made all these claims, I had to convince all these people to come and anytime you got new press it was I had to convince them I'd do it.
29:14
Every time I got investment, I had to convince them to do it, but more than anything else I had to convince all these people to come work on this.
29:21
And I followed that story many times but the day that I made the announcement internally
29:28
called this all hands, some people already a little bit apprehensive because we've been through a couple of different like, here's the last thing we're going to try.
29:35
There's wasn't a day when we normally had no hands. And I locked eyes with someone as soon as they started talking, who two or
29:44
three months before I had convinced to move to a new city with his wife and
29:50
two-year-old daughter away from where his in-laws lived.
29:56
Their in-laws were hoping to take care of the kid, he moved to the city, bought a house, and I was going to tell him that he didn't have a job anymore.
30:02
Those are really, really, really hard, I mean I think that that's a, like the impact on me reputationally or financially was, in the grand scheme
30:12
of things, relatively insignificant, I haven't just bounce back again.
30:18
But that's more than just disappointing someone like I was going to come meet you for dinner and I bailed at the last minute or something like that,
30:27
this is like I convince you to alter the course of your life in a really significant way and then didn't It didn't happen.
30:35
So that was very, very difficult, in the end knew like a little bit of positive news because we had five and a half million dollars left of that money.
30:44
We're able to shut down in a relatively elegant way, so we made a portfolio site which had everyone's resumes and
30:51
did a bunch of reference letter writing and kind of career coaching and.
30:57
Helps get everyone a job, in most cases a better job than they had when they were working for us.
31:02
And we were able to give customers the choice of their money back where we could donate it to charity or whatever, but and that one person,
31:11
Tim Leffler, ended up joining slop bucket a year later. So that part all worked out too, but doesn't mitigate at all like what it felt
31:18
like in that moment, it was really pretty terrible. >> That's pretty heavy, so how do you go from that terrible moment to
How did you go from terrible moment to launching Slack
31:28
launching Slack which reached a billion dollar valuation in record setting pace of eight months?
31:38
>> That worked out super well [INAUDIBLE]. >> [LAUGH] >> We had developed a system that was
31:43
the proto-Slack. Again, 92, I mentioned that one of the software
31:49
network tools that I used was called IRC or Internet Relay Chat. And we used IRC at the company that made Glitch, and it's a very old technology.
32:00
So it's With most messaging systems, and probably every messaging
32:05
system you've ever used, there's a concept of what's called store and forward. And if I want to send a message to you but I can't reach you right now,
32:12
there's no connection to your endpoint, your client or your device, it will just be held and then forwarded to you the next time you connect.
32:19
But IRC didn't have that. If you weren't connected at the moment that I sent the message, you would just never receive it. So we built the system to log the messages.
32:25
But once we had the messages in a database, we wanted to be able to search them. So we built search on top of that. And then bit by bit, kind of feature by feature,
32:32
we built things to integrate with our file server. So when someone uploaded a file, it would get announced in the IRC or
32:38
if an alert went off in our data center, then that would get put into IRC. And slowly we developed the system which was really the foundation of all of
32:48
the ways in which the company communicated and was really beneficial until we realized none of us are ever going to work without something like this ever again.
32:56
Other teams of [INAUDIBLE] software developers would probably like it as well, and so we decided that's what we're going to do.
33:03
And we thought that one day in the fullness of time, if we had every single person who could possibly use this,
33:10
we would have a $100 million in revenue and thereby be a billion dollar company. And that just happened very quickly.
33:17
>> [LAUGH] >> Yeah, I definitely think the math checks out. So at Slack, you created a product that not a lot of companies knew they needed.
How did you convince companies to use Slack
33:25
How did you convince them otherwise? >> That was tough, the first first three or four external teams to use Slack.
33:31
It took dozens of tries like going to their office and showing them.
33:38
And I think we learned a lot there about,
33:44
Marketing probably isn't the right term. And I think we actually had this problem a little bit with Flickr because Facebook
33:51
came out and just stole the social photo sharing market while Flickr was trying to decide whether it wanted to be social photo sharing or a community for
33:58
people who are interested in photography. But if you can't explain what you're doing well enough that someone to whom you
34:04
explain it can go on to explain it to someone else, then it's a real problem. because otherwise, you're going to have to do all the explaining.
34:11
So we struggled to figure out the way to talk about it, what advantages it had, what it was for.
34:17
But when it's net new and it's not replacing something else, it's very difficult. I don't know if it's still frequently read but there's a classic book
34:27
in marketing called Positioning, Jack Trout and Al Ries I think. And one of things they talked about is if something is a new concept for you, it's
34:36
almost impossible for you to get purchased in somebody's brain, in somebody's mind. You have to find something else that already exists there and
34:45
then alter that idea, which is why you hear Uber for whatever. Because if you had to explain the whole thing from scratch,
34:52
it's just very difficult. It's why you hear movie pitches that are Jaws meets Star Wars or something like that.
34:58
>> [LAUGH] >> And it's much easier to get that than to start from from scratch. But it was like it was a real slog to get anyone to even try it.
35:06
And the encouraging thing was once people started trying it, they almost invariably stuck with it.
35:11
They've logged in every day, became like it was for us the foundation of how they communicated. >> And so from 2014 to 2017, there was limited competitors for
How did you feel when Microsoft launched Teams
35:21
Slack given that it was such an innovative idea. But in 2017, when Slack had more than 100 million revenue,
35:29
which you predicted 650 employees and evaluation of around $5 billion, Microsoft launched their team's app.
35:37
How did you feel when you found out that app was coming out?
35:44
>> I think mostly just good because it validated the idea and
35:49
we had some advanced notice that it was coming out. because we've worked with Microsoft on something, like early stuff with
35:58
Microsoft research on building question answering box for first lock.
36:03
And had a pretty good relationship with a guy named Qi Lu who was a software exec at
36:08
Yahoo, who was the CTO of Microsoft. Left around them to go be to take over Baidu.
36:15
But we weren't especially worried just because when it was, before it was first announced, it was called Skype teams and
36:23
had a pretty different approach and was just so far behind us from a product
36:29
perspective that we weren't worried about people switching. >> Okay, so now in 2020, how do you feel about Microsoft's Team app?
36:38
>> Well, it got a lot better as Microsoft [INAUDIBLE]. >> [LAUGH] >> I think there is a bunch of things
36:44
that, That make it much more of a challenge for us today than it was then.
36:51
And it's not just that it's better because it's actually not better enough compared to how it was that any of our large customers could switch to it.
37:01
Our biggest single user is IBM,
37:06
somewhere close to 300,000 daily active users over 10,000 workspaces and Teams is limited to 5,000 users per workspace and you can't federate them together.
37:15
So there'd just be no way to support that Structures and what didn't work for them and there's many other things that are very,
37:23
very fundamental limitations over 5,000 people. You can have 200 channels and if you want to add the 200 first,
37:30
you have to add, delete one with all of the messages, but none of that really matters in the face of if you want to be able to
37:37
collaborate on the word doc with track changes send it back and forth. You're lawyers working on a contract or
37:44
marketing people working on a press release and you are an Office 365 customer, you more or less have to use Teams now.
37:51
And the 100 million users of Skype for Business are being migrated over to the Teams because Skype for Business is being shut down.
38:00
So there's a bunch of things that are kind of force it but
38:06
maybe most fundamental is we have 12 million.
38:11
I don't even remember what our public number is on daily active users. 12? Yeah, okay, so- >> [LAUGH]
38:17
>> 12 million and there's at least 200 million people for whom FAQ or something like it is the preferred way to work so
38:23
200 million people whose working lives are mediated by email. And they are moving over I think is inevitable.
38:29
So that's 6% which means 94% of people don't use it yet.
38:36
And if you don't use it and you don't have any idea and and you hear that there's two alternatives, one's Slack and one's Teams.
38:44
And because you're an Office 65 customer, Teams is already free and integrated with all of your Microsoft tools.
38:51
Then why would you even evaluate Slack? Or Microsoft was aggressive in a way that I think was surprising to a lot
38:59
of people even who watched that company closely, like putting out a press release
39:05
with our daily active users in it during our quiet period, post the listing.
39:11
But if they can put out a press release in tank or share price, and you're not watching this stuff very closely, you don't have a fighting degree
39:19
of resolution, then you might think as a customer, why would I invest in Slack?
39:24
They're just going to be out of business in three years. Microsoft's going to inevitably kill them. That doesn't, it would be a waste of my time to even look at it.
39:31
And it's not like at that point, the fact that they are different really matters to you because you don't use either and it's not really replacing anything.
39:38
So it's much more of a threat now. I think we underestimated the degree of importance. The Financial Times Person of the Year was Satya Nadella.
39:46
And so there's a big write-up of that. And there's six consecutive paragraphs that are about Slack and there's no other,
39:54
maybe the names of some competitor companies are mentioned in one sentence.
40:00
Here and there, but like it's the biggest chunk of it. And so, I think that's because of all the things that can be used
40:10
as leverage by Microsoft to expand relationships inside our businesses.
40:16
Exchange, the email server, and the fact that people are very
40:21
used to Outlook is like the principle one that kind of gets them in.
40:27
And that makes it difficult for people to switch. And if people stop paying attention to email,
40:32
if email declines in relative importance compared to other software we use, that's a really difficult position for them.
40:39
So from their perspective, I think, and this is what she knew we thought back like 2016.
40:45
This is in fact, successful to the maximum extent that's an existential threat to Microsoft.
40:52
But I don't think that's actually true because so many other things would change in the world on the path to that.
40:58
But I think that is a thought process. >> So, despite selling out and actually becoming a consultant,
What advice do you have for creating diverse workplaces
41:05
I studied mechanical engineering in undergrad. And as a black engineer, I really appreciate what Slack has been doing from
41:13
the perspective of diversity and inclusion. Back in 2015, Slack shared a diversity report which revealed that most of their
41:20
black employees were in technical roles, contrasted with a lot of companies that will hire black individuals primarily into administrative roles.
41:27
And in that same report, 45% of managers were females. So to a room full of individuals who will start companies or be at companies,
41:36
what advice you have for creating diverse workplaces? >> Start early, I think that's the biggest thing.
41:42
When we were 20 employees, I would say,
41:47
between 20 and 30 maybe. Wow, there's a lot of white dudes.
41:53
>> [LAUGH] >> And in that case, it wasn't too late, but it was close to too late.
42:01
It was like more of a slog to get started. Because what happened was, we have one black woman engineer, and
42:08
then another one comes to interview and she sees the first one. And suddenly it's like a completely different assessment of what's going on
42:16
here, and then there's two. And then the third one comes for interview, if feels like there's community, and people talk, and have a network.
42:23
So, getting started early I think is the most important thing. I think it can be a kind of a fraught topic I think for people.
42:35
People aren't sure what to say or they're uncomfortable. And I think there is a really pervasive and
42:41
incorrect belief that you would have to lower the bar to hire someone who isn't the canonical candidate,
42:50
the archetypal candidate for this role. I think that's usually not the truth for two reasons.
42:57
One is, you just have to look harder, you're going to see more people. And in fact, that can raise the bar.
43:02
But people have different challenges in their life, and I don't think you can perfectly understand someone's background
43:13
just from their gender identity, or their ethnicity. But on the whole, for a woman to get to a certain place in
43:23
her career, they had to work a lot harder than a man. For a black engineer to get to a certain place in his or her career,
43:32
they had to work a lot harder than, this is where it gets fraught. In Ben Horowitz's words, Jewish, Chinese, or Indian guys in Silicon Valley because
43:42
there's just like these networks that are very powerful. And you have an enormous advantage.
43:48
So for two people with equivalent credentials, the person who's probably going to be more talented, more capable, and
43:56
had to overcome more obstacles to get to where they are is going to be the one who doesn't have the traditional archetypal presentation.
44:04
>> It's amazing. Thank you for sharing that, I'm sure, I hope people were taking notes. >> [LAUGH] >> So
What has changed about your leadership style
44:10
we've gone through the journey of your career. You started as a web developer. You founded a company that was acquired by Yahoo.
44:17
You launched a second company that raised more than $1.2 billion in venture funding, and you eventually took that company public.
44:23
You've been a leader throughout this entire time. What has changed about your leadership style and what stayed the same?
44:34
>> [INAUDIBLE] It's always hard to really assess yourself.
44:41
I think I'm relatively self aware even of those things that don't work and it doesn't matter that I know that they don't work.
44:48
I still can't change them. But there is a difference in the mechanics
44:55
of being a leader at different scales.
45:00
Because when it's 20 people and we all kind of know each other, it's very different. I say something and then we argue about it, and
45:08
maybe I change my mind, and it's all good. There's a power dynamic where I'm the CEO and whoever, and
45:16
everyone else is not the CEO. But when you get to 500 people or 1,000 people, where we're at now,
45:23
a couple of thousand people, it's very different. Someone's going to come into your presentation for
45:28
some new product development. And it's like a relatively new designer or engineer, or
45:33
product manager you've never met before. To me, this is just like a one more 30-minute meeting in my schedule,
45:41
which is [SOUND]. And for them, this is something they've been thinking about for weeks.
45:46
They probably talked to their spouse about it, and they're either excited or they're nervous, they want to know.
45:52
So the degree of impact that my words have is like,
45:57
from the perspective of me, crazy out of proportion to the amount of action.
46:05
So in other words, it's like a super, super powerful microphone on at all the time.
46:14
So if anything's negative or critical, if I have a relationship with someone
46:19
that I've worked together for a long time, it's not really a big deal. If it's someone that, that might be the only time they interact with me ever in
46:28
their whole career at Slack. Or it might be the first interaction they've ever had with me, and they might not have another one for several years.
46:36
It carries a huge amount of weight. So it's hard because, is that the amount of time we have like,
46:42
including questions from everyone? >> That is. >> Okay. >> [LAUGH] >> I'll try and
46:48
be a little bit more concise. >> [LAUGH] >> I
46:55
remember reading on Twitter people arguing about Warren's tax plan. And someone said something like, if Dwayne The Rock Johnson just paid this
47:04
tax at this rate, then we'd have an extra $50 million. And then that's how much it would cost to solve the water crisis.
47:13
And it struck me as just a totally absurd argument because federal budget is something like $2.7 trillion.
47:19
So 50 million bucks plus or minus is not the reason why that doesn't get solved. It doesn't get solved for all kinds of reasons.
47:26
And people think that way all the time, that it's just like money or it's just resources.
47:32
For anything significant to happen, certainly anything that involves dozens of people, let alone hundreds or thousands.
47:38
The amount of will that has to go in, the amount of like selling, the amount of vision, the amount of like coercion and cajoling, and
47:46
the amount of encouragement, and support. All of those things is just enormous. So, the game does change as the company gets bigger and things evolve.
47:57
And I think probably only gets more difficult, but. That's what I've been learning this whole time
48:06
is how to do that without like crushing people. How to do that without creating
48:13
an environment where it's entirely top down like iron fist from above.
48:19
And it can be tough because I have a different perspective than anyone else because I see everything. So I talked to someone in engineering, I get a head of sales reports to me,
48:28
head of marketing reports to me, head of finance reports to me, our general counsel reports to me.
48:33
So I have a very different perspective than what is ultimately relatively narrow.
48:38
And generally, a better idea of what we need to do. because I also talk to customers more than pretty much anyone else other than the sales person.
48:44
And I talk to our investors more than anyone else. And I talk to our board more than anyone else.
48:49
Yeah, it's really, but I think there are better sources than me for like top ten tips.
48:59
Because none of them seem that simple to me. And it's not that they're not out there, but the real challenge of leadership and
49:08
maybe there's one book I would recommend, which is Leadership and Self-Deception.
49:13
The real fundamental challenge of leadership is the same as the fundamental challenge of just being a human being.
49:19
And I think that's, This will sound a little bit weird, perhaps.
49:27
But living with an open heart and not seeing other people as, on one hand, either instruments that can be used to your advantage or
49:35
obstacles that are in the way of something that you're trying to do. Which is the default judgement of all
49:43
people with whom you are not close instinctually. So like you're on a Southwest flight and people are still boarding and
49:52
the middle seat between you isn't taken. And you're like, please don't take this seat, please don't take this seat,
49:57
please don't take this seat. A person has a whole life and their own ambitions and
50:03
desires and heartaches and stuff like that. But to you, in that moment, they're just a potential pain in the ass that might take the middle seat next to you.
50:12
And that's pervasive, and when you're really trying to accomplish something, it can be very tempting to see people as either instruments or obstacles.
Audience Questions
50:22
>> Amazing, so we're going to go to the audience for, we probably have time for about two questions.
50:28
So?
50:35
>> Hi, Stuart. Really appreciate your comments on diversity, so it makes me feel better about my Stanford Slack addiction.
50:41
>> [LAUGH] >> My question is, what were some of the key and best things you did on the product and design front in the early days of Slack?
50:48
So for example, how much of Slack's success do you attribute to your personal eye for design, versus hiring the best designers, versus feature prioritization,
50:58
or even just the insight about having a personality? Curious what advice you'd share there for aspiring entrepreneurs.
51:05
>> Yeah, so I'm not sure I want it like slice it up by who gets more credit.
51:11
But I think the fundamental approach was how much easier can we make people's lives.
51:16
And when I look at other products, it's really, I'm trying to think of the shortest version of this I can.
51:25
It can be an amazing app, and if the password reset thing doesn't work, and I need to reset my password to use it, then I'm just locked out.
51:31
So there's very basic, fundamental things that you have to get right,
51:36
and which aren't the interesting ones. In fact, someone Tweeted something the other day which I liked that kind of
51:42
illustrates this from a different perspective. And it's someone asking Ray Kroc, the kind of founder and
51:47
the first CEO of McDonald's, why was McDonald's so successful? And he says, because we have clean bathrooms, and they say, that's easy.
51:54
That's so simple. That doesn't explain it. And Ray Kroc said, are your bathrooms clean?
52:00
And it actually is like a challenge. So there's some real fundamentals.
52:06
But the things that we did that were most successful were those things which made life more convenient for people.
52:12
And one of those was for example, typing your password on your phone is a pain, so we'll send you a magic link that logs you in.
52:18
Or because for complex reasons, most people wanted to have notifications for
52:24
every message in Slack when they first signed up. So they felt comfortable and knew how it worked. But we didn't think that was a good way for
52:31
them to set their preferences long-term. After a few notifications, we would interject and say,
52:37
would you like to switch to our preferred settings? And that kind of thoughtfulness or consideration,
52:44
that kind of thinking of yourself as a host and the customers as your guests, is the secret, as it were, to good design.
52:53
>> And we have time for one more question. >> Can you hear me?
52:58
>> Yeah. >> Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. So in your answers, it was really clear that like, what you've been interested in
53:05
is kind of facilitating communication through different mediums. Whether it be video games, photography, now Slack.
53:11
Was that understanding clear to you through your journey? And if not, was there like an aha moment that you realized this
53:17
was what the issue you really wanted to work on was? >> Yeah, well, so the desire was there, but
53:23
I didn't think I recognized it as one single thing. because Slack is also a massively multiplayer workplace software.
53:30
I mean, that's kind of the principal distinction between Slack and pretty much every other tool.
53:37
And it is very much like the games that we wanted to play. You take objects and you can manipulate them and
53:42
distribute them and form groups and all of that. But I don't really recognize them as being fundamentally similar until much later.
53:49
The thing that I thought as being the common thread was just it's all software. And software that groups of people use together to me is the most interesting
53:59
type of challenges, because it has all the regular challenges of scalability on the one hand and design and usability and the other.
54:07
But social dynamics because of the feedback loop where the output of the system can also be an input to the system are much
54:14
more difficult to design for and therefore much more interesting.
54:20
>> Amazing, thank you all for the questions. Dharma- >> Yeah. >> It's been a pleasure chatting with you. >> [LAUGH] >> It's not often that we get time with
54:27
a classically trained philospher. So I have a new spin on our typical lightning round.
54:32
I'm going to ask you a few questions that keep me up at night. Is that okay? >> Yeah. >> Cool. >> [LAUGH] >> So we'll start with an easy one,
54:40
is water wet? >> Yes. >> [LAUGH] >> Okay, if soap hits the floor,
54:45
is the floor clean or is the soap dirty? >> Soap's dirty. >> Yeah.
54:51
>> [LAUGH] >> Dirty soap, all right. I have to make sure I pronounce this one the right way.
54:57
>> All right. >> Does expecting the unexpected make the unexpected expected?
55:05
>> No. >> No, we're going with no? >> Yeah. >> Okay, final one, you're ready?
55:12
