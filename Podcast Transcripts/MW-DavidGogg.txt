I'm trying to build people up I'm trying to armor their mind I'm trying to get them the belief because this world we
0:05
live in is tough it will beat you down the world and the life that we live in is the ultimate competitor it will try
0:11
to take you out it will find your weakness and it will just Hammer you if I can help you build belief build
0:17
confidence to the point where nothing can hurt you because you know exactly who you are
0:26
David Goggins welcome to the show hey man I appreciate you having me brother thank you thank you for being here where
0:31
have you been for the last four years you've been jumping out of helicopters and fighting fires and what have you been doing well I did that last year
David's New Career of Smoke Jumping
0:37
right I guess this year I did that but I've just I just do me you know I'm out
0:43
there running working out and uh just trying to find out more of what this is all about trying to find out more what
0:49
I'm all about so that takes me getting away you know I'm not about even doing these
0:55
podcasts man so not nothing against you but um I'm not about all this stuff I'm
1:00
not one that likes to hear himself talk a lot um about action and action means
1:08
less talking and more doing so that's where I've been what is that smoke
1:14
jumping stuff so basically it's um you know about Wildland firefighting about
1:19
when the forest has fires there's a lot of times there's roads and there's access to get there so these you
1:27
know whether it be a um hot shot crew or whatever these different Crews who come in by vehicle
1:34
they can get into the fire that way what a smoke jumper is is you can't get a
1:40
vehicle into that place it is a spot where it's tight there's no vehicles there's no access
1:46
so they'll send us in there smoke jumpers jump out of airplanes and we'll land in these really tight small Drop
1:53
Zones with all of our gear and we'll put the fire out how do you take Walter in we jump out so
2:00
everything is hang on you're jumping out of a airplane parachute with
2:06
backpacks of water like a camel pack type thing so we'll jump out we'll have this it's called a ditty pack and it and
2:12
it sits in you know it sits like by your waist you know yep on your legs area when you jump out and that has a lot of
2:19
your gear but what happens is once you jump out the aircraft would go lower and
2:24
will push out all the rest of your gear your water pumps oh and that'll get air dropped in
2:30
with its own little parachutes right right so a lot of our main gear gets dropped into us and then we're out there
2:36
for several days until the fire is put out by us and only us that's insane it's insane yeah why'd you
2:43
do that well when I left the military um you're I'm always looking for more
2:48
I'm always looking for what's the next thing for myself how can I grow and that right there was the next thing
2:55
for me you know I didn't want to sit back and you know just enjoy my retirement for the military that's
3:01
there's there's no growth in that so I decided to go out and do this so you jump out of an airplane with a
3:08
team you get your kit also parachuted out of the back you're now in the middle of an area where there's no Evac there's
3:17
no vehicles that can come and get you there's a fire you need to put the fire out and you don't stop until you're done
3:23
that's it sometimes there is a way to get out but a lot of times it's just you know if
3:30
someone gets hurt on the jump a lot of times we have to build like cut down a bunch of trees so a helicopter can come
3:36
in land and get them out so we are the only access we have to save ourselves
3:43
so a lot of times we are the team to get us in and to get us out what was the
3:48
longest Mission exercise I think the longest one I did was seven days
3:54
so and what's the sort of daily routine are you sleeping do you get much sleep at all no not really so what happens is
3:59
and the thing about being in Canada so I do this out of uh out of British Columbia so what happens is there's a lot of
4:06
daylight so when I'm out there man there's a lot of daylight in the middle of the summer
4:11
when it's hot when you've got tons of right okay that's right so there's not much there's not much dark so you're
4:17
basically working a lot of hours so and then when it gets dark you're actually working through the night time and then
4:24
you get a little you know you get a little rest and you wake up and you add it again and then when the fire is out you Patrol
4:29
the fire make sure there's no more hot spots make sure everything is black and wet because we we literally wet the
4:37
whole area down so there's no hot spots and then that's all done we'll demo which means we'll clean up
4:43
all the stuff all our hoses you know we'll we'll pack up all our stuff and then we'll we'll get out of there did
4:50
you ask to be paid for this I I get about I think the the pay is about
4:55
12 to 15 bucks an hour so it was funny about it man like when I
5:01
first started doing this job um people didn't know that you know I'm actually
5:08
successful in business and then it realized that I was like basically turned down millions of
5:15
dollars to do this job and they can continue thinking it to make 15 bucks a
5:20
month to make 15 bucks an hour so yeah but you know like I said for me the the
5:26
whole money part of it it's it's not what it's about I'm all about that growth and that
5:32
growth isn't in these massive paychecks for speaking to corporations stuff like that the growth for me is in that 12 to
5:39
15 an hour when you're out there and it's like 20 you know 20 degrees and you're
5:45
freezing your ass off and you're thinking you know what I don't need to be here anymore and you start questioning yourself while
5:52
you're here and there's a lot of growth in that why did you decide to release another book what Was undone with the first one
5:59
well the first one was basically um a bachelor's degree with the mind is how I look at it and no
6:07
one knew who I was so this is the book never finished is the book that I wanted to come out first but how am I going to get so deep into
6:14
something when no one knows who the hell I am so first I have to give you some backstory on who the hell David Goggins
6:20
is some credentials that's it and so I got some basic credentials out there and now I can dive in more because most
6:27
people think I'm just some good animal who runs and yells and just says [ __ ] [ __ ] all the time and that's
6:33
nowhere near the truth that's maybe what they see in a one minute video and
6:39
that's what people believe but there's a lot of thought behind a person being a
6:44
born loser becoming who I am today you'll just wake up and just Rocky the [ __ ] you gotta
6:51
wake up and think about you know there's a process to getting better and that process is never finished
6:58
it's an appropriate title so one of the things I've been thinking about is the danger of success making you soft and
The Danger of Success Making You Soft
7:05
this must be something that you've battled with over the last few years right more money more attention more
7:11
Fame more free things if you wanted more opportunities to go places and do stuff with people right how have you
7:17
dealt with this battle of success not making you soft you have to cap it you have to learn to cap success
7:24
so what I do is like right now I don't like doing podcasts there's a
7:30
lot of things I don't do have to do now to get the messages out there to help people out and what I mean by capping success I
7:36
believe everybody should live their life so everything that someone says in life take it with a grain of salt
7:43
take what they give and don't be like oh David goggin said this or whoever said
7:48
this no do not take what I say and do exactly what I say
7:55
so for me what makes me who I am because my mission is very different than yours or anybody else's
8:00
I have to go into a situation okay I'm a guy who wants to make people
8:06
better for people to get better I have to continuously get better myself
8:12
for me to do that I can't just say oh I have this resume the resume is there
8:19
forever I'm good I have to cap My Success because for me to help people out I can't just say I
8:26
did it once and I'm good I have to continue to reinvent the will of the Mind
8:32
and figure out more and more ways for you to pull because if I have a cookie cutter message it may hit five people
8:39
out of 25. you just failed my message needs to be in a way where I
8:46
can hit all 25 people it needs to be broad enough to where all 25 people may not like the
8:52
message but they're getting something from it and that is evolution you must
8:58
continue to evolve and you don't evolve from me in my job unless I cap myself
9:03
somewhere and say okay you made this much money get back to [ __ ] work it's time to get back to work
9:10
stop hearing yourself talk get off the podcast don't be on social media too much cut out all the [ __ ] noise get
9:17
back to the [ __ ] mental lab because that's where the knowledge came from so for me I must cap myself so I can come
9:23
back with better more unique knowledge versus the you know all that cookie cutter knowledge that's out there
9:30
that's why people buy the books I have because it's not cookie cutter it's real knowledge the other thing now is when
9:36
you first started you were a Lone Ranger right nobody really knew who you were outside of some
9:41
obscure endurance places and half-hard truths of these weird myths right but now you've got people's expectations lay
9:48
it on top as well so not only have you got to deal with success potentially making you soft so you've got to cap
9:54
that you've got to say no to more money and opportunities and cool people right you've also got this extra layer of
9:59
expectation that's coming through from other people too and I think that you talk about change humility right in the
10:04
new book too I've got to presume that that fits into this equation right it fits in big time
10:10
um and that's one big reason why I do fight fire because the all the knowledge for myself
10:16
comes from that place it doesn't come from the place of success my knowledge does not come from a place
10:22
like because for me like I built Goggins from the ground up I was born David
10:27
Goggins David Goggins wasn't good enough he was a scared bullied
10:32
uh abused kid who struggled in life and that kid whenever something got
10:40
tough no matter how hard I trained remember how ready I was whenever something got tough for me
10:47
David Goggins the real David Goggins would come out and he would quit
10:53
so I realized this over a period of time so I had to build Goggins
10:58
and in that process I have to go back to that mental lab in that mental lab is at scratch that
11:06
mental lab isn't that trained humility and so that's where I get better
11:12
I get better when I'm digging holes in the ground when I'm waking up early
11:18
knowing I don't have to do these things that's where I get better so it's important to stay hungry it's important to stay hungry but it's important more
11:25
to stay humble within that hunger so while you're hungry a lot of people are hungry
11:31
but humility is everything what was that story about William Crawford the janitor yeah so this guy
11:38
won the Medal of Honor so he won the Medal of Honor and which is the highest award in the military
11:45
and this guy went to the Air Force Academy
11:51
and he was a janitor and no one knew who the [ __ ] this man was he had the highest award in all the
11:59
military for heroics for heroics saving lives putting his life in a line could have you know could
12:05
have been killed and he is now basically you know cleaning [ __ ] for young
12:13
kids and we can all imagine how that probably went you know there's probably some you
12:18
know a little bit of taunting here and there and he just sat there and cleaned the [ __ ] so that's why he's in my trained
12:24
humility part because for this man to be at the level he was and have that kind of humility to go I'm a medal of honor
12:32
winner but I'm gonna put that in my closet and I'm gonna pick up my broom and dustpan and I'm gonna pick up you
12:37
know this Rag and clean this [ __ ] for these young men that right there is amazing for me man
12:42
that's that's where you grow that's that's growth huge growth and also it shows that he was doing his job
12:49
he was a servant he didn't look at himself any better than anybody else the second you do that you totally lost
12:56
you cannot look at yourself like people with me even I always look at people I I know where
13:03
you are I know where because I've been there that's why I helped so many people out I've I've never been above you I've
13:11
always pretty much been beneath you and that's where my knowledge came from so I know how to reach those people who are
13:16
in the dungeon because I've been there so many times speaking of getting too soft did you see
Is SEAL Selection Too Harsh?
13:23
that there was a news story that came out recently about the treatment of seals during their selection process do
13:28
you see this yeah I saw it yeah they were getting uh sprayed with tear gas whilst they were on the ground and they
13:34
were made to sing Happy Birthday so that they couldn't hold their breath while it was happening and there was a quote from
13:40
this guy I think this type of training is really senseless said Sven yort a
13:46
Duke University associate professor who studies tear gas and its effects it looks more like a form of hazing right I
13:52
see all that trust me like I said you know I'm not gonna sugarcoat anything
14:00
I understand that guy I understand exactly where you're coming from that is your personal opinion and I
14:07
totally get that but there's very few people in this world
14:13
who want to do a job like that and it takes a different kind of mindset
14:18
is it tear grass appropriate I don't know how hard that training is I don't expect
14:25
anybody to understand it but one percent but the loud voices of this world are
14:33
the 99 who don't understand exactly what you have to do that's why when I speak
14:38
and you don't understand me it's probably a good thing because that probably means I'm in an area of life that you're not
14:46
in which is fine that's why I don't judge people and this guy right here judging that unless you've been there
14:53
and done that and you really can't speak about it unless you're in those
14:58
situations that are so hard that takes a special human being to get through them
15:04
I think it's the same kind of feeling that I get when I heard about Elon Musk
15:10
telling the employees at Twitter we're going to ask you to work harder than you've ever worked in your life
15:15
yeah this is a place Twitter is now a company where people can go if they want to be in the top not Point not not one
15:21
percent of hard-working programmers and software developers on the planet that's right and there was everybody was up in
15:27
arms this is unbelievable we're going back to this old version of capitalism where the the worker is being abused and
15:33
used and thrown away what they didn't account for is that there is a non-insignificant cohort of people for
15:40
whom that's their dream that's right people who want to be able to get up on a morning having gone to bed four hours
15:45
before and can contribute to some sort of progress that they think this this is what I'm here for yep and
15:52
it's the same with the seals if you're not the sort of person that is built to go through selection it's like speaking a different language
15:58
that's it and that's why I don't try to convince people otherwise I understand
16:04
that why you're confused I understand why you say things like
16:10
that I'm not saying anything bad about that I understand it but also what you don't
16:16
understand what you fail to understand is the other side that you need people like that you need the Elon musks you
16:25
need the David Goggins you need some of these Navy Seals some of these other people you need those people
16:31
and they don't they forget that and it takes a very very unique
16:37
person and unique mind to do some of these jobs that are necessary in this
16:42
world especially when we're thinking about someone going to war right do you want your Armed Forces to be underprepared for the battlefield
16:49
because he didn't want to be too mean to them in advance that's that's the problem that's the
16:55
problem and that's a problem that I've always had I've always had is that right there is
17:02
that with even even some of the most trained people in the world fall back on that it's easy to talk
17:09
about like I said when you go through it once we it's a perishable skill
17:17
hardness mental hardening mental toughness it's a perishable skill
17:23
just because you went through some training once and you got through it doesn't mean it lasts [ __ ] forever
17:29
and that's where most people hated me in my life because I realized that
17:36
you don't just say oh I got it I'm checked off I'm good for rest of my life that's why you have to recall you recall on [ __ ] everything
17:42
and you definitely must recall when it comes to the mind that is one of the biggest re-qualifications you must have and when
17:49
you're at that level you gotta recall every [ __ ] day not once a year one of the other things that you did to
Running the Moab 240
17:55
stop yourself from getting soft was running the Moab 240. yep talk me through that experience so
18:02
um I had to run 100 mile race and I think it was about six years you know I had
18:08
you know some heart surgeries I had some maybe some questioning in my mind about
18:14
I call it part-time Savage I started kind of going through this I started getting you know a little bit injuries a
18:19
little bit there's a little bit things that back in the day never slowed me down so when I got my head on my ass and
18:25
realized that hey we have more left we can still push harder we're not there yet
18:32
I realized talking to a guy named Cameron Haynes he just raised 240 mile race
18:37
and um I'll say I'll go is this the is this the new level is this the new is this the
18:43
new push so when I decided to do that race it was in the back of my mind like man
18:48
I've really become an expert at running 100 mile races so for me this was the new level
18:55
did 200 plus mile race and what was so amazing about that as you probably read
19:01
in the book I had a hard time the first time doing it I came back and did better but
19:07
what's amazing about the human mind is that it becomes your new Norm
19:13
like to to think that I can run 200 miles 240 miles and that becomes like
19:18
running 50. I never thought that was possible this is why I'm I'm always pushing that limit
19:24
because I know that within pushing these limits there's always more
19:30
so I end up doing like almost like back to back 200 mile runs when the tours at Myra is 240 my race
19:38
was hard at once it became something that was very easy after I figured it out so that's why
19:44
that happened well you got lost on the first one oh yeah and then you went to
19:50
bed and woke up halfway through the night and nudged Kesh and said how long have
19:57
we got left until the end of the race but because you hadn't completed the
20:03
official route you couldn't go across the official Finish Line yeah so you ring your race
20:10
um like Paces some of whom had gone home yep what like what what do you think it's so three in the morning and you're
20:16
ringing people saying you know that race that we just finished because of health problems right let me go back and finish it so the crazy thing about that in that
20:22
in that spot so I got lost the first time I got seriously sick was off course so
20:29
basically I bed down about 12 hours then I got back in the race I was still part
20:35
of the official race now okay so the first time I got lost I got sick got back got lost
20:41
got back in the race after 12 hours of being out of the race so now I get to about 200 and some of my
20:47
miles and I'm sick as hell can't breathe how to pulmonary edema totally jacked up
20:54
and now the doctor tells me if you get off course now and you go to the doctor
21:00
you won't be able to come back and finish the race so I had to make a call like you know what I'm pretty messed up got off
21:07
so this is where you're talking about I'm literally laying in bed and I'm feeling better
21:13
and I thought honestly I swear to God I thought that someone was speaking to me
21:18
I thought it was Jennifer it was like you're not done yet [ __ ] and I'm like
21:24
what the [ __ ] is this it was actually probably my subconscious saying get your ass back out there
21:29
so I wake Jennifer up I'm like hey how much time do we have into the cutoff I know that I'm already you know dnf'd so
21:36
man what happens here I'm not going to be an official finisher of this race this isn't for Glory no this is now for
21:43
the fact that you can so either you can sit here and not and think about that for a whole
21:49
year and you come back here and do this or you can go out there for yourself and take some some kind of pride in knowing
21:55
that you could and you did so basically I wake her up how much time
22:02
left she goes something like I don't know what it was what'd you say what time was
22:07
like you know whatever and half my crew had left and there's two people there I woke them
22:14
up they were going to get on a plane I said look can you guys help me out I have 40 miles
22:20
to go I'm going to have Jennifer drop me back off at the spot where I left I
22:25
don't want to finish this [ __ ] race and I couldn't cross the finish line because I wasn't an official finisher so
22:32
I ended up finishing on a road on you know by by a telephone pole and
22:37
that was my official finish ended up being like 250 miles 255 miles
22:42
but it's one of the best races of all time because we're going through it fast but all the [ __ ] times that I was
22:51
like this is I I'm not going back and I went back I'm not going back and I went back I'm not going back and I went back
22:57
it showed me even more of what we have as as humans if we're willing to go
23:02
there and we're willing to push that extra step and like I say you know I always tell people a lot of people man
23:08
how do you do what you do at the end of the day I asked myself one question can I take one more step
23:16
and usually the answer is yes so if you can answer that question and not take
23:21
another step that is real failure that is real quitting so a lot of people can take one more
23:28
step but they choose not to I don't know if you can take two steps you got to answer that question after you take the first step
23:34
but I can always take one more step so if I choose not to that's on me and I gotta live with that
David's One-Second Decision Theory
23:40
does not LinkedIn with the one second decision yes yes so the one second decision is I had
23:49
to live through that one second decision several times during this race so this race
23:55
took me a hundred and some hours okay and this is what people don't get
24:00
for you to finish that race even though I dnf'd I still finished in the time so there's a lot of pride in that
24:08
if you're a hundred and some odd hours let me use hell week this is a perfect example hell week's 130 hours
24:16
and 130 hours is a lot of seconds a lot of [ __ ] seconds
24:24
and if you lose let's say you win every second but one
24:29
you lost it only takes one second for you to lose the whole thing so the one second
24:36
decision is just that you're in a situation where life is sucking let's say you're in extreme cold
24:42
water and your life is flashing before your eyes every time that wave goes over your
24:49
head your thought processes I gotta get the [ __ ] out of this water
24:54
and you're in hell week and your hour one of 130 [ __ ] hours
25:01
it's all fun and games okay because at the beginning of Hell Week the guns are
25:06
going off it's like a pep rally so you're [ __ ] hyped up and your boys are linked arms and you're getting
25:13
sprayed and it's like a [ __ ] pep rally there's structure yelling at your bombs are going off concussion grenades
25:19
blanks from in 60s yeah who ya [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] yeah yeah [ __ ] yeah
25:27
but then what they do is they shut that [ __ ] off they shut it off
25:32
all that who yah all that hype it gets real quiet and they March you out to that surf zone
25:40
for something called surf torture and it's got water that Pacific Ocean is cold as [ __ ]
25:46
so no more pep rally you're now in your head you're linked arms with you know your
25:51
brothers beside you you don't know if they could be there long or not you don't care anything about yourself
25:57
you lay back and that first wave hits you your mind
26:02
goes straight from hour to all the way to hour 130. you can't
26:09
process five days of this [ __ ] you now you're now in a [ __ ] you like I gotta
26:14
get out of here you're in fight or flight it's cold I can't be cold this long and then this that one second decision
26:20
comes in you forgot every reason why you wanted to be there you don't care about seals you don't
26:27
care about any of this you don't care about fighting for your country you don't care about that goddy gold Trident
26:32
that they put on your chair you don't care if I need that [ __ ] no more all you want to do is go back home you want the
26:39
warmth you may want something to eat you want your girl to hold you all those things of comfort are there in that one
26:45
second and this is where people lose so what I do in that one second because
26:51
we all think about quitting when shit's hard but what you have to do in that one second is hard to process information
26:59
during pain because that pain takes over and you can't think rationally
27:07
you're thinking about fight or flight save yourself that's not a rational thought it's not a thought that's going
27:13
to get you through hard times most people fail that one second so what
27:20
happens what I do in that one second and there's a bigger process to all this but in that one second
27:26
I physically stayed in that water because if I get out of the water I quit
27:31
so I physically stay in the water but mentally I'm on the [ __ ] beach with the
27:36
[ __ ] instructors and the instructors it's cold outside so they got these Parkers on they got their cup of [ __ ]
27:43
Joe and they're warm because they've already been through it so now it's your turn to go through it
27:48
so many I get back with them I'm still in the water physically but mainly I'm back with you I'm chilling I got my
27:53
Parker on and now I'm thinking logically because I'm warm now mentally I'm warm
27:58
I've taken that one second let's not quit yet guys let's [ __ ] think about your options
28:05
where are you going to end up if you quit this [ __ ] where are you gonna go where are you going to say to yourself
28:10
because you know you're going to get warm the second you get out of this water you're gonna take a shower and you can be warm and you could be and
28:17
in five days you could be out so I start thinking logically I calm my brain down because your brain
28:23
just wants to get the [ __ ] out ring the bell put your helmet down get warm and then you're really [ __ ] and these are the things you have to
28:29
think about the one second decision so that's that's all about it's about gaining control of your mind
28:36
putting things back in the proper perspective and then saying I really do want to be here
28:43
and I'm gonna have a bunch of these one seconds through this 130 hour Journey
28:48
and I have to learn to control these because if I fail one of these one seconds I will not be a seal I will not
28:55
be a doctor I will not be a lawyer I will not be whatever the [ __ ] it is so that's how important that one second decision is it's all about your mind
29:03
taste control you you have to say [ __ ] you I run this [ __ ]
29:09
and that's what that's all about we'll get back to Goggins in one minute but first I need to tell you about element element is a tasty electrolyte
29:16
drink mix with everything that you need and nothing that you don't I've replaced my morning coffee with element every day
29:21
for over three years now and I've never looked back it means I've optimized my hydration my brain feels better I'm not
29:27
getting mental fog and it's helping me to curb Cravings if I'm fasting throughout the day even video guy Dean
29:32
uses it my favorite flavor is the orange that in a cold glass of water upon waking feels really really good it's a
29:38
science-backed electrolyte ratio of sodium potassium and magnesium which helps me to fill up my absolute best all
29:44
day also they have a no BS no questions asked refund policy so you can buy it
29:49
and try it for an unlimited amount of time and if you do not like it they'll give you your money back and you don't even need to return the box that's how
29:56
confident they are that you love it head to drink lmnt.com modern wisdom to get a free
30:03
sample pack of all eight flavors with your first box that's drink lmnt.com
30:09
modern wisdom projecting yourself forward to see
30:15
what are the consequences of failing what are the consequences of stopping yep is about as powerful of a motivation
30:22
strategy as I can think of you know because what you're doing is you're trying to optimize right now to stop the
30:28
discomfort that's right but what you're going to pay for that in is shame and guilt and regret long term that's right
30:35
so what you need to be able to do is bundle all of that up that is as yet unfelt but will last for way way way
30:42
longer you know the future is much longer than now that's right the future is going to extend out up until the day that you die and the now is just for now
30:49
and even 130 hours is just 130 hours that's right and you get to look back and you look back with Pride and Glory
30:55
why'd you look back with shame and guilt that's it that's that's the one second you just summarized it right there and
31:01
most people feel those one seconds and then that one second leads to 20 years 30 years 40 Years of [ __ ] I have
31:09
people who have been through training with me Ranger schools SEAL training Air Force training and I get calls from them
31:16
today and they have great lives and all they talk about is how they failed in
31:22
that one moment and they can't even break they can't even enjoy their life
31:28
now because they're now warm they're now warm there's no more
31:34
suffering there's no more suffering for me either and we're in the same boat now
31:40
but you're suffering and I would so we're not suffering but you're thinking about what you could
31:45
have been I am exactly what I should have been and that's where people start to lose it
31:52
because now I I realize that in that one second I go through all that I know how it's going to feel because I failed so
31:58
many times before failure is the ultimate thing man I failed so many times before that's why I
32:04
look at failure anymore it's failure I look as my first second and third attempt so that's what that's all about man well
32:10
I mean he went back to go and do Moab again a second time right which is your second attempt that's right
When Moab Round #2 Wrecked David’s Ass
32:16
had you banged your knee up it was pretty bad in between the first and the second one it was pretty bad way before either one of them uh-huh yeah yeah it
32:23
was it's been jacked up now for about 20 years I've seen some gnarly photos of it recently it looks yeah interesting yeah
32:29
so all those miles I've run on this thing is it's uh it's been a lot of uh it's been a lot of gut checks
32:36
so you go back you do Moab a second time yep and then you turn your ass into like
32:42
a hamburger or something as well so it's not just the knee it's the ass as well now yeah so at Mile 201
32:49
we have a good video of it matter of fact Jennifer is like there's some people up there so at so 201 is a spot where I was
32:59
really finished in the first Moab so that was a um it was a way market checkpoint yeah
33:05
the second time so Jennifer is extremely happy right now because I'm there yes and she knows I'm doing well now I'm
33:11
doing good we're gonna get through this and so she's videoing me as I'm coming up this climb on this road and she goes
33:18
there's some people up here who want to meet you you're doing so amazing I said my ass is [ __ ] up you need to get the
33:28
[ __ ] Desitin cream and it's literally for like 20 [ __ ] miles
33:35
that like people don't get it man when you get raw like that bro and you're walking because you the
33:43
chafing of my ass it was hamburger meat and I'm like so she's all [ __ ] happy
33:48
and [ __ ] she's and I just look at her and I'm gonna put the video up on social media because it's but she's a [ __ ]
33:56
Trooper bro hang on so could she was a leakage oh yeah that was on the video
34:02
from behind so my shorts were absolutely raw dogged
34:07
yeah so when you pull them down it's just blood and so she goes in the bathroom because
34:13
she didn't know what she was gonna see she has a Desitin cream she walks in there
34:19
and I pull him down and spread them open and I go put that [ __ ] all up in there so
34:26
she goes in for the kill and she's putting this Destin cream all over the [ __ ] place man and you know what
34:33
that's the funny thing about it that's when you know you got a good [ __ ] with you man when you're
34:39
that raw and you're that [ __ ] up and she's just like nothing it was like saying hey can you like put some lotion
34:46
on my back before I go lay out that's how she was in there man getting in it That's it man have you considered that
34:52
that might be the most traumatic event of all of the things that you've done in your life what you ask Jennifer to do that day no not at all she did worse
35:01
so that Leadville chapter when I talk about after I finished and then the ultra raveling or
35:08
unraveling had begun when I lay down so oh that was on the duvet and you didn't
35:13
know the word duvet yeah I know what the [ __ ] dude blanket man okay yeah fair enough count
35:19
from the streets we call them blankets okay anything that you wrap up is a [ __ ] blanket cool so I'm laying on the duvet
35:27
and she's all [ __ ] like about her damn ratings that [ __ ] the Airbnb
35:32
[ __ ] and I'm really like hey I'm about to [ __ ] because it's not your place no
35:38
okay no right yes I can see that scene is uh is is was was bad but once again
35:46
like a crime scene it's yes it was a crime scene so you've done all of this
35:51
stuff right you've done the seal selection week three times strapping the
35:56
legs up so that you can run a bad water Ultra race the Asperger's everything yes
36:02
of all of the physical Pursuits that you've endured which has been the most painful by far by far
The Most Painful Pursuit Of David's Life
36:09
my first hundred my race by far this 2019 Moab the one that ID
36:17
enough but still finished that's up there but when you are
36:23
um so I guess you're you're not prepared to run 100 miles and you take it for granted
36:30
and you didn't do any training at all and you had the right nutrition and off a whim
36:37
like literally like you know what I want to raise money for a foundation that's how that happened so I don't know if you
36:42
know a story or not but basically I'm sitting there and the Lone Survivor
36:48
incident happened with a bunch of you know some seals died I want to raise money for him I went to training with most these guys
36:53
so I had the bright idea to uh raise money you know I wasn't gonna do a hot
36:59
dog or hamburger sale I was gonna do something that people would be attracted to so I Googled the world's toughest
37:05
events and where it comes up is this race called the bad water 135. it's 135 mile
37:12
race through Death Valley in the summertime now I had no idea about ultra running I
37:17
know what the [ __ ] ultra running was but when I heard so when I saw 135 miles
37:23
I automatically assumed it was a stage race where you ran like maybe 10 15
37:29
miles bed down and you got next morning did it so when I call the race director up Chris Kaufman I'm like hey I would
37:36
like to do this race to raise money for a foundation he goes have you ever run 100 miles and I was like like in in a week or like
37:43
like were you talking about he goes no like in 24 hours because that's what you got to do to qualify and I was like is
37:49
that even is that even possible like I I no so anyway he goes no you can't get in my race
37:55
unless you qualify and I call him up on a Wednesday and that Saturday and I was a
38:02
bodybuilder at the time I did cardio 20 minutes a week on the elliptical trainer every Sunday
38:08
he goes yeah Saturday you're in San Diego Saturday is a 24-hour race where
38:15
you run around a one mile track for 24 hours and if you can get 100 miles I'll consider you in my race
38:21
so I'll go sign up for this race and the first 70 miles I'm doing pretty
38:27
good and then I hadn't sat down I was uh had
38:33
to go in the bathroom I was eating I was drinking mild Plex and Rich crackers I
38:38
was you know eating Rich crackers Elite nutrition yeah elite elite high quality nutrition
38:44
so what happens when you're that ignorant and you go out to do this race and you
38:50
sit down in the chair your body's done so I'm sitting there and when you sit
38:55
down for the first time in over 12 hours your body's now going through some metamorphosis
39:02
like go [ __ ] at home go go to a doctor get some help but I'm sitting there and I have this
39:09
urge to go to the bathroom and there's a porta potty for me that [ __ ] wall but I can't get up because
39:15
my blood pressure's all messed up from my great nutrition that was on and so I
39:20
can't stand up so I look at my ex-wife and I literally say I want to [ __ ] on myself right now
39:26
so I sit there and I'm [ __ ] up my back and I'm peeing blood down my leg and I have 30 miles to go
39:33
and I end up finding a way to get through that 30 miles and when I
39:39
got done with that race it's the worst pain I can ever even I can't even describe
39:47
the pain of that last 30 miles to anybody no one it's very hard whole body whole body
39:54
um so when it ended I I I'm literally dizzy going up my stairs to get to my
40:00
house I'm literally I have my arms wrapped around her going up the stairs and every flight of stairs I got I have
40:06
to lay down because I can't stay upright for too long or I'll pass out so I
40:12
finally get in the house and I get in the house I'm once again on the floor I'm in the kitchen on the floor just
40:18
laying there I finally make it to the bathroom into the tub I get rolled in the tub and
40:25
she puts the water on me I'm just laying there with the water coming on me and what I pee out looks like Coca-Cola
40:33
and I'm laying there in the worst pain of my entire life I'm shaking I'm jacked up
40:40
and all I could think about was I can't believe what I just done
40:46
because when you get to 70 miles of a race and you felt the way I did
40:52
it's to me it was humanly impossible to even think about going 30 more miles
40:58
in that shape and once you do it what what came over me when that shower hit me and the reality hit that
41:04
I spent 100 more miles in that last 31 miles was something that
41:09
I can't even describe to people and she's like we gotta get to the hospital
41:15
so at the time my mom was seeing this doctor and he was like you know so so she's describing to my mom I'm going
41:21
through he's like you gotta get in the hospital now and I just said just just shut up
41:27
and let me enjoy this pain I don't want anything to numb it I don't
41:32
want anything right now because what I had done was I just in my mind and people will take this wrong and take
41:39
as long as you want to I don't really care I had just climbed a mental wall
41:46
that was amazing and I didn't want anybody to take that pain away from me at that point because I was that was all
41:52
confirmation it seems like I've heard you tell that story a number of times it's amazing
41:58
did that set the tone or the Rhythm for what you wanted to try and Achieve and
42:04
feel again each time this you're pushing further there's more difficulty I never want to feel it again
42:11
I never want to feel it again but what it did was it showed me what is possible
42:17
and that's what set the new stage for me that's when I realized oh man I've
42:23
really been underachieving my entire life I'm not saying that you have to go to that place because that place is a
42:29
dangerous dangerous place that borderline rhabdo hot everything it was all that yeah but you know
42:37
you don't want to go there but it taught me what is possible so from that 19-hour
42:45
lesson for the best biggest lesson in my life it taught me like okay I got it check
42:51
tell me about this mixed type of hate that you've made so what started happening is as you get
Why Make a Mixtape of Hate Messages?
42:58
bigger as you get more successful you open the door for people to critique
43:05
every [ __ ] thing you do and most of the people who are critiquing you usually aren't Where You Are
43:12
and all their critiquing comes from people who are really at a low level of life which is sad but what we do
43:20
people who are on the upper level hearing the haters at the lower level like I said you'll never meet a hater
43:25
doing better than you true statement I started having fun with it
43:31
so I'll go through the comments While most people don't go through comments I go through them intentionally look for
43:37
the bad ones and why I'll block and delete you because the people on my page don't need
43:43
that negative energy I'm blocking deletes you but I take a snapshot on my phone and I put it in the archive
43:51
so what happens is there's days where I'm like you know what I really don't want to do this today
43:57
and I'm like oh hang on so I started making these mixtapes with
44:03
all of these hate messages about people talking [ __ ]
44:08
and it became such a source of fuel that it was amazing because I know why you
44:14
hate me you hate me because you're probably in the bed right now you're probably an underachiever you're
44:20
probably somebody who doesn't want to do anything with your life so I make you question everything about
44:28
yourself so I'm going to continue making you question yourself by coming out here and being even more
44:34
successful so I listen to that while I run I sometimes played in the house
44:40
and it sometimes gets on Jennifer's [ __ ] nerves because I'm sitting there listening to somebody talking mad [ __ ] on the loop about me and she's like why
44:48
do you do this [ __ ] it's half comical it is half um it's half inspiring I'm
44:55
actually inspired by it I've heard you say previously that listening to music while you train is cheating so what
45:01
you're telling me is that the Silence of your own dark thoughts isn't enough of a
45:06
soundtrack and you've had to crowd Source insults from the internet self-narrate it yep and then play it to
45:13
yourself while you train that's it I do that sometimes yes yes have you got your
45:19
phone on you right now I want to hear it no I I don't travel with my phone oh yeah my phone does not go with me
45:25
anywhere why is that once again man like right now I'm with
45:30
you a lot of times people are in conversations or they're somewhere elsewhere you may think they're with you
45:37
but they're not that phone is the biggest distraction in the world with the time so when it comes time for
45:43
the phone I'm on the phone we're not I don't use it I'm all about being present where I'm at so that's why that phone
45:50
right now you know no we do have it it's in your it's silenced it's off so I do have my phone right now but but usually
45:56
I don't take anywhere I go okay so while you're listening to the self-narrated insults of random people
46:03
on the internet that you don't like right what are you thinking of while you're listening to that while you're working out or while you're walking
46:09
around the house how'd that back in the day when I was sometimes getting bullied or in a dark
46:15
place uh sometimes that would have bothered me how I would want to
46:21
clap back I I would want to be on there all day explaining myself to people and
46:27
how now I'm in a place now where I can hear it and I can actually enjoy it I can
46:32
actually know where it's coming from I've studied it so I don't just like listen to it and like make fun of it I
46:38
actually study it because I was once that negative person I was once that person who saw someone successful
46:45
and didn't see how can I get there I was like oh [ __ ] that they're probably
46:51
cheating or they're probably doing this I was I was that negative person because I wasn't there and I didn't want to work
46:57
to get there so these people who hate on people I've studied them
47:03
and I've gained a lot of Knowledge from them because I gained a lot of knowledge for myself when I was in that dark place
47:08
so it's almost like reflecting an older version of you back to yourself 100 I had this idea
47:14
um uh called the reverse role model so in a lot of places people might grow up and not have good Role Models around
47:21
them you know like it would be great if I had someone that was my hero that could tell me how to be x uh good in
47:28
school well with work fantastic in relationships whatever it might be and a lot of people don't grow up with
47:34
that right and what I realized was because that was me in in part from where I was from but I realized there
47:41
was a lot of people that I got to see that were like the sort of person I didn't want to be like right and that
47:46
was the reverse role model so I could look around I could say I really don't want his relationship with his wife and
47:52
I hate the way that he is using alcohol to get over the problems in his life he
47:57
doesn't have any Integrity or tell the truth she is a liar and a backstabber and a gossip
48:03
and the thing is that you can actually achieve a lot of success in life by avoiding failure like most success in
48:09
life actually is avoiding failure yes you need to be able to be competent But first you need to not get out of the
48:14
race that's the one second decision right you need to not lose before you can win right and the reverse role model
48:20
is you weaving your way through a selection of people that you don't want to be like and I think that you can get
48:25
an awfully long way just by doing that I did that my entire life I had the ultimate blueprint by watching my family
48:33
I was the youngest kid so the youngest kid has the total advantage you know you may get picked on you may
48:39
get bullied with everybody but you sit back and exactly what you said I sat back and watched my dad definitely don't
48:46
want to do that my mom my brother whoever it may be I sat back and I paid attention to
48:52
everything around me and it was the ultimate blueprint to how to live life not to live life how not to live life is
49:00
I watched people do [ __ ] I said uh I don't want to be like that
49:05
I like what you said about how the criticism that you see from people
49:10
is coming from a very unique place I think if you got to see the inner texture of the people who don't like use
49:17
existence you'd feel more pity than anger for the most part I think you'd pity them yes
49:24
um and that's a realization that's taken a long time for me to to come up with because
49:29
everybody else feels or to me always seems like everyone else has got it together because I get to see only what
49:36
you choose to say only what I'm around you doing that I get to see whereas I
49:41
get to observe my own inefficiency and foibles 10 000 times a
49:47
second right I get to watch the texture of my own mind be completely unresponsive and useless I see every
49:52
single um prideful decision every single lie that I tell myself every single time I
49:57
make a promise and don't keep it I don't get to see that from everyone so I'd always presume because of this asymmetry
50:02
that everybody else had it sorted and I didn't and it also made me think that everybody else's opinion was this
50:07
perfectly balanced well-researched beautifully it was it
50:12
was they had they had me nailed down to a t what they were telling me was the truth they could see something in me
50:18
that I couldn't right and after a little bit of time and a good bit of building up of
50:24
self-confidence I realized that that's not the case no I have pity in a lot of people
50:30
I do um I used to get angry about it like there was this guy I talked about it on
50:35
on Rogan this guy from so Team Six who went out there when I became started
50:41
becoming more famous he went out there and just tried to destroy me try to literally destroy me talked about
50:47
how you know he's totally lied totally lied had to get a lawyer against him all
50:53
kind of [ __ ] and I was getting ready to Sue this guy I had a great I was going to sue him
50:58
because he literally tried to destroy my character my reputation went out there
51:03
in this lightest ass off and I thought to myself it's about two months into it I stepped
51:10
back and I started feeling sorry for this guy like really sorry for him I was gonna
51:15
pull the trigger assume and I said I'm not gonna Sue this guy I said for you to be
51:21
this person who comes on and lies and tries to literally tear down
51:27
everything I've worked for you are in a very very bad place coming
51:34
to find out he was in a very bad mental place so I get what you're saying I've learned to study
51:41
people before I react because there's no successful person in the world who's in a good headspace
51:47
that's going to ever attack anyone in that kind of manner there's always going
51:52
to be something wrong with them so you gotta always dive a little deeper before you get your feelings hurt before you
51:58
get your feelings hurt by that bully at school or that boss at work
52:03
take time take that one second to pull back and study them
52:09
because most people were in good places they don't they don't care about what you're doing they don't care about what
52:15
you're doing they'll try to destroy you they actually will try to build you up versus destroy who you are as a person
52:21
so that's where I'm at now in life is most people who do that doing a very
52:27
dark dark place I've got a ton more to talk to Goggins about but first I need
52:32
to tell you about ag-1 you are not eating enough fruit and vegetables in your diet and you know it this is going
52:38

What People Get Wrong About Motivation
53:36
they think it's a permanent fix they think it's something that
53:41
that is a constant they think that maybe once I get it I'm
53:48
gonna hold on to it and that's the thing about that I was telling you I always talk about
53:54
it's nothing that's permanent nothing is permanent and a lot of times you have to learn to perform without
54:01
motivation you have to learn perform without purpose you have to learn to perform a lot of different things and that's what
54:08
people think they think I need to have this motivation to work out to study to be better so if
54:16
they don't have it they just don't [ __ ] do it and that's where you fail
54:21
you have to learn to train your mind well beyond motivation if you have
54:27
motivation that's great that's them can lean to the fire all it takes is a little bit of [ __ ] spark you can burn
54:32
the whole Forest up but motivation you have to learn to exist without it you have to learn to be you
54:39
have to be your best self and your least motivated and that's the tricky part about all
54:44
that [ __ ] motivation is just a word you have to have these different things in your mind on where you want to go and
54:51
know that motivation is not going to get me there because I'm not going to always be motivated Jaco said the exact same thing
54:57
you said that discipline needs motivation for breakfast and discipline is good too but without a clear headspace there's no
55:04
discipline what do you mean so let's say we have a circuit breaker
55:10
okay and I'm loading everything up to one [ __ ] circuit just load it up
55:16
it's gonna [ __ ] blow and once that thing blows man the circus all [ __ ] up
55:22
you gotta have each thing plugged into the right spot like a [ __ ] crowded garage
55:30
you can't put anything in it once your brain is crowded discipline is great motivation is great but if you can't fit
55:38
[ __ ] in your brain because it's all [ __ ] cluttered with [ __ ] there's no discipline
55:45
you may have it sometimes when it fits in that crowded garage of your mind but you don't have the
55:51
consistency that you need to have with your discipline so what are you talking about here are you saying doing self-work and reflecting on you as an
55:57
individual are you doing therapy I call it my I call it mental zones I don't get
56:03
in too much because it'd be here all day but basically is you're organizing your mind so you
56:09
can put that discipline so a lot of people talk about discipline okay great why do you fall off the
56:15
[ __ ] wagon why can't I continue with this routine going to the gym being
56:21
better waking up early eating the right Foods it's because maybe it's your kids maybe
56:27
it's your wife maybe it's your job and it's all just stuffed in your [ __ ] brain you don't have it
56:32
compartmentalized and organized in these nice shelves like you look in the garage it's all [ __ ] a nice organized
56:39
militant garage hey where are my dumbbells right there a lot of people whose brain Hey where's
56:45
my demos uh let me look they're [ __ ] throwing [ __ ] they're looking through toads they're all [ __ ] up
56:51
so where am I gonna put discipline in that mind if I can't find other [ __ ]
56:56
you gotta be able to find all these different things in your mind oh I can put discipline right there
57:03
I can put consistency right there I can put all these things right there in that spot so that's what I'm talking about if
57:10
your life is not organized in your life being everything around you
57:16
because it takes one little [ __ ] up piece of an outside interference to
57:22
clutter your whole mind because it's on such a knife edge that's right and people don't get that your
57:28
mind has to always be clear that's why that's why I meditate two hours every
57:34
single night because I refresh I reorganize the garage which is my mind every night so
57:42
then disciplines in there organization everything is in this right spot so if I
57:47
wake up I'm ready to go what does a morning look like for you at the moment if you've got a routine of some kind yes I run every single morning
David’s Daily Routine
57:54
so that's time you up when are you waking up I'm up about five five thirty so every morning it starts with the Run
58:01
and that's because that's the one thing I hate to do more than anything in the world so that's like my cup of coffee
58:08
and I'm all about armoring yourself so the second you leave your house
58:14
and the second you open your phone the second you do any of that [ __ ] you are now letting in poison in cancer
58:22
so I make sure a lot of things you can't avoid so as I get up I start to armor
58:29
plate my mind and body like a person's going to war you put your body armor on that's what I'm doing on that run
58:35
I'm waking up and I'm giving myself all this armor so when I come out in the
58:41
world now look at that phone I'm ready I'm not waking up late I'm not rushing
58:46
around I'm not disorganized because I know I'm gonna get hit in the [ __ ] mouth there's a there's an art to
58:51
getting hit in the [ __ ] mouth and that is why these things are important you have to wake up and you
58:58
have to give yourself belief you have to give yourself confidence that it starts with that run so after the run
59:05
I come home I eat something small how long's the Run typically at the moment nowhere Under 12 miles
59:12
so 12 miles is the minimum and what are you getting that done in how long it depends right now I'm running a heart
59:17
rate so I'm doing it like 8 15s 8 30s because I'm retraining right now because is that zone two for you zone two yeah
59:24
because of the leg surgery I had so I'm going back starting from scratch so
59:29
anywhere from about an hour 30 to two hours I run every day so so you're fasted on the morning oops
59:36
straight out straight out 90 minutes to two hours of running back eat and I'm in the gym
59:42
so and then after that um to whatever's on the plan for the day
59:49
that's how that works every day are you still doing your stretching because you've got two hours of every night two hours of meditation 90 minutes to two
59:56
hours of running how long is the gym session depends 45 to an hour and a half okay
1:00:03
stretching meditation run eat Jim
1:00:09
what is that my mission Jennifer oh yeah yeah forget about that you cycle
1:00:15
as well yeah how long are you cycling it just depends I do stationary bike right now a lot what are you using is it like
1:00:20
a what bike or something similar yeah something similar so I put my bike on a uh like trainer and I cycle yep at least
1:00:28
three or four days a week I'll do that so that's your day there's no there's there
1:00:33
is no room for anything else yeah there is a lot of room so there's 24 hours and I use it all pretty pretty
1:00:41
well how how's your sleep what's your sleep like it's really good okay eight hours something like that seven eight
1:00:47
hours yeah but you need to with this sort of volume seven eight hours and you're still doing your stretching stuff
1:00:52
every night so you've got a four hour block basically of stretching and meditation that's all in one block you combine the
1:00:58
two right yeah that's all in one block cool yep that's one hell of a day it is and
1:01:03
it's been like that for seven years but going back to what you said before about needing to cap success
1:01:08
you wouldn't be able to fit well even one tenth of that in exactly if you were
1:01:14
chasing down exactly yep that's exactly it so if all that's [ __ ] up that's why
1:01:21
I got a cap success because I can't put that in do and and that's my growth
1:01:26
factor so you know that's that's my human growth factor you said before about
How to Build Unshakable Confidence
1:01:33
um how you build up self-esteem and confidence and stuff and there's this quote from one of my friends Alex homozy
1:01:39
that says you don't become Confident by shouting affirmations in the mirror but by having a stack of undeniable proof
1:01:45
that you are who you say you are outwork yourself doubt yes that's that's nailed nailed completely
1:01:52
nailed yes because a lot of people will in some of these motivational people out here is is the funniest thing in the
1:01:58
world to me they'll go and say when you wake up in the morning pound your chest you know [ __ ] look at yourself in the
1:02:05
mirror and do all this [ __ ] [ __ ] I hope it works what works for me is that everyday
1:02:11
resume the things I know of accomplished the things I know I've done real hard work the real calluses on my mind the
1:02:18
real calluses on my hands that's that's it the you don't need to pound your chest in the mirror to [ __ ]
1:02:24
anymore if you have that it seems like especially with confidence right or self-esteem there's a relationship
1:02:30
between confidence and competence so what you're looking to do is try and have what you believe that you can do be
1:02:36
ahead of what you can do right you're not looking for it to be delusional you don't want it to to be able to believe
1:02:41
that you can do something like fly right but you need to have a relationship between the two but what people are asking for is for their confidence to be
1:02:48
so far ahead of their competence that or without having even been competent to anything in the beginning and that's
1:02:53
just delusion that's fantasy right well I believe that you have to build belief belief is like there's an after-school
1:03:01
special belief where the mom says believe in yourself and that's all great
1:03:06
but there's also a built belief and the built belief is one where you
1:03:12
are constantly like for me I came from a bad place How I build belief is through
1:03:18
the the daunting tasks I put myself through so that's proof
1:03:24
positive that I can so it correlates and that's how this
1:03:30
piece of [ __ ] kid I once thought I was don't believe by saying hmm
1:03:35
I was in three hell weeks I went to Ranger school I tried out for Delta
1:03:40
selection undeniable stack of proof that is proof [ __ ] so whenever you think whenever you think you can't
1:03:47
confidence comes from the thing that you built you must build belief you must build
1:03:53
confidence it can be like hey um I'm Gonna Knock that [ __ ] out
1:04:00
you gotta look over here and say I can knock that [ __ ] out
1:04:05
is belief and it's built on what you put in to yourself another friend sent me a
1:04:11
message this morning knowing that we had this this big thing that we've been working toward for a long time today he said uh Nietzsche said I know of no
1:04:18
better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and impossible the fact that something seems impossible
1:04:24
shouldn't be a reason to not pursue it that's exactly what makes it worth pursuing where would the courage and
1:04:29
greatness be if success was certain and there was no risk the only true failure is shrinking away from life's challenges
1:04:36
you know that one also two for two no that one also man yeah it's that um
1:04:43
it's not dealing with laziness and self-doubt thing I think uh
1:04:48
and I do wonder how many people use the look in the mirror pound the chest stare
1:04:53
into your eyes say your affirmations don't get the results and then lose confidence
1:04:59
well that's part of it a lot of it is limited Horizons limited Horizons are like I use me as an
1:05:07
example always I came from a small town in Indiana
1:05:13
where there was a handful of black families and a lot of people in that town when you
1:05:20
come from a town of 8 000 people it's like we had a local plant
1:05:26
Great Dane and like you know what I wanna work at Great Dane and get a house next
1:05:32
to my mom that's what you know so many of us come from these small places in our mind
1:05:39
that we're not willing to think outside of only what we've seen
1:05:45
our mind works in such a small compartment and one thing I was able to do was to
1:05:51
dream many people but don't make dreams your [ __ ] master
1:05:57
but I was able to dream outside those [ __ ] Four Walls of that small town
1:06:03
and until you're able to really put yourself into that dream but don't make
1:06:09
dreams your master that's where you truly become what you're destined to
1:06:14
become what you mean don't make dreams your master a lot of people sit back and they dream about being
1:06:20
a sports figure or dream about being a seal or dream about being an astronaut
1:06:25
and all it is is a [ __ ] dream they don't put the work behind the dream that dream has become their [ __ ]
1:06:32
master when you become the master of your [ __ ] dream is when you say I want to
1:06:37
go be a Navy SEAL and you say okay I'm gonna lose 106 pounds in less than three [ __ ] months
1:06:43
the dream was the one thing I thought about and the dream was now gone now
1:06:48
what comes in the dream goes away and the [ __ ] laundry list the [ __ ] details and tasks come up gotta do this
1:06:55
God do this God do this gotta do this that's when you become the master of your dream so a lot of people out there dreaming
1:07:03
Ryan holiday says talking about the thing and doing the thing Vie for the same resources allocate yours
1:07:08
appropriately that's it that's it that's the way it works as well that's the way that the brain works you can
1:07:14
actually get these kicks of dopamine by telling your friends about I'm going to be a Navy SEAL I'm going to start my training next week it's going to be
1:07:19
great I'm gonna feel like this feels good it feels good to talk about that [ __ ] man it actually makes you feel good
1:07:24
makes you feel proud all that [ __ ] but guess what happens that alarm clock goes off at 4 a.m to train
1:07:32
um I want to be a seal today but I don't want to be whatever today I'll start
1:07:37
tomorrow and that's the usual pattern of people's lives that's why
1:07:43
I talk about clearing out the mind until you really want to do something you're always going to be a talker you always
1:07:50
get run your [ __ ] mouth so again with the audio version of this
Sharing David’s Mother’s Difficult Experiences
1:07:55
book you've done podcasts in between each chapter where you're recapping what's just happened and this time you
1:08:01
brought guests one of which was your mother right and you spend a 35 minute
1:08:06
conversation sitting down with her and talking about the experiences that she had with your father and reflecting on
1:08:13
that right a lot of stuff you'd elected to leave out of the first book so that
1:08:19
means there's been a journey that you've gone through to get to the stage where both you and her and collaboratively you
1:08:26
felt okay sharing that publicly right like what's that process like because
1:08:31
your mum didn't ask for this I mean you kind of also did you put a book out there because you thought it was useful and now millions and millions of people
1:08:37
know about you but right you know the uh gravity field of your notorite is
1:08:42
starting to bring other people in as well so what was the Journey of getting to that stage like well it wasn't so much me I had already laid out you know
1:08:50
a lot of [ __ ] about me that was you know pretty embarrassing and can't hurt me so for her that actually helped her out
1:08:58
she said wow if he had the courage to go out there and tell people all your [ __ ] you know and so that process was it took
1:09:05
about four years of me working with my mom because you know she was very damaged by what she
1:09:12
went through and so was I but I knew no one was coming to save me so I had to go ahead and fix my [ __ ] and she kind of
1:09:19
lived in a different place but whenever it can't hurt me it started waking her up
1:09:25
the hey man why do you care why do you care so much when people think about you what you went through
1:09:31
why why are you putting so much so much on other people and what they may say about you like
1:09:38
there's some stuff I talk about you know that is pretty embarrassing for some
1:09:43
people but she got to a point of life where she was able to you know stop caring because
1:09:49
we all have our [ __ ] no one like people it's so funny to me there'll be people who are out here
1:09:55
commentating about people who are [ __ ] up out here famous people are [ __ ] up and I don't know how they're able to do
1:10:01
that when I guarantee while your skeletons are not being out there
1:10:08
if I were to open up your [ __ ] door [ __ ] how how how are you doing that so I know that about everybody
1:10:16
like people love to talk [ __ ] about somebody and keep themselves out of it and so we went through that journey
1:10:23
together and so it allowed her to come out and say yeah [ __ ] it you know I'm a big person who
1:10:29
I want to give people the confidence to walk in the room of a million people and none of them like you and you just
1:10:36
like to say [ __ ] you I'm good and walk out with you by yourself and you helped your mom do that as well
1:10:42
and now she can look at everybody and say yeah I [ __ ] married a [ __ ] that choked the woman to death
1:10:48
I was in a bad place I'm good with that
1:10:54
one of the days that you focus on a good bit in that conversation is the day that she decided to leave your father right
1:11:01
and take you into your brother with her was there anything that you learned about upon reflection
1:11:08
where both of your experiences uh opened up a new realization to you
1:11:15
that that was a hard time for her and and for me also I was ready to leave a long time ago I was just waiting for her
1:11:21
to get the courage to finally leave him and um I don't think anything from that really
1:11:29
I think that's where the damage really began I think for her when she left it almost
1:11:36
her fight went away and it's kind of like when you run
1:11:42
100 miles when you sit down your body can then say that's exactly what I was thinking I'm
1:11:47
done it's exactly what I was thinking the second she left
1:11:52
that the Mind said oh my God like we can we can be human it's like PTSD yes we
1:12:00
can be human and we're not fighting anymore and it just swarmed the demons
1:12:07
that all that fight and all that [ __ ] was keeping away it just came and it swallowed it swallowed her whole it also
1:12:15
swallowed me whole but once again like we were talking about I got a chance to watch her
1:12:20
and she set out the ultimate blueprint on how not to be
1:12:26
so I had a hard time learning growing up but I was very smart when it came to
1:12:31
human beings a genius because I lived in such hell I was
1:12:37
always studying people who can I trust who can I not trust energy I got really
1:12:42
good with energy can I this person's energy good is it bad so I became a
1:12:47
genius on human beings so I studied people all the time
1:12:52
I studied all the time she also talks about considering taking your own life oh yeah
1:12:58
were you aware of that before you started working toward this book yeah so yeah she she talked about that a few
1:13:04
times with me behind closed doors and um I'm surprised she did it
1:13:11
you know there's a lot of stories that are still Untold that she probably will never talk about and I'll never talk about him until she
1:13:19
says it's fine but um yeah it was it was a bad it was it was a bad way so I I
1:13:24
gave her credit for having the strength to say okay I need to continue on and figure out you
1:13:30
know what's next for me but she says the only reason that she didn't go through with it is because of you and your brother because she knew that she would
1:13:36
be leaving you in the hands of this Tyrant that was going to mistreat you even more badly now that she wasn't
1:13:43
around to protect you yeah which is a it's beautiful but it's also kind of a lot of pressure it feels like a lot of
1:13:50
pressure for a child to be the reason for his mother to to still be there and it's also a
1:13:55
dumbing conclusion about the state of her life right that the only thing
1:14:00
stopping you from taking your own life is these two boys but it's also
1:14:06
beautiful in a way because a lot of people only have one thing
1:14:13
you don't need a lot of things sometimes only thing that kept me with that one step forward was one thing
1:14:19
and so that one thing can get you to two things to three things the four things
1:14:25
so that was the beautiful thing about that is that now she's 75 and she's retired because of that one thing
1:14:32
how I mean you're having this conversation with your mum during the production of
1:14:38
the audiobook you're having a conversation which is difficult to have in private right with
1:14:45
two microphones in front of you knowing full well that this is going out to millions of people it's going to be scrutinized it's going to be listened to
1:14:51
it's going to be reflected on how difficult is it to watch your mother opening up about an experience which to
1:14:58
you was traumatic and then reopening those wounds in front of you and talking about that for millions of people to
1:15:04
hear oh it's hard it's hard but
1:15:10
it's necessary why to be able to own your trauma
1:15:16
to be able to own everything about you and look it in the eye like there's a part in eight mile
1:15:24
with Eminem the very end when this white boy you know [ __ ]
1:15:30
trying to make it in the rap world and getting beat down and [ __ ] comes from some trailer park [ __ ] and
1:15:37
he's like how the [ __ ] am I going to win this rap battle because my best friend got shot
1:15:43
in the foot and this dude slept with my girl and all this [ __ ] so what he does
1:15:49
to take all the power from the [ __ ] gonna rap battle his ass he's like
1:15:54
I'm gonna tell you every [ __ ] thing about me I'm just gonna [ __ ] tell you
1:16:01
and that's how I feel about life and that's how my mom now feels about life
1:16:06
I'm just gonna [ __ ] tell you everything a [ __ ] about me I'm not gonna hide I'm not gonna do none of this [ __ ]
1:16:12
and it's a refreshing feeling when you can get in front of millions of people get an audiobook and you can go
1:16:18
through your [ __ ] and lay it out and you walk away there's no more secrets
1:16:23
there's no more secrets like people say oh hey Lance Armstrong you do steroids no no no yes
1:16:32
well I have nothing I have nothing wrong with Lance Armstrong anybody else
1:16:38
[ __ ] telling [ __ ] man and guess what happens to the conversation it's over
1:16:44
it [ __ ] ends there's a really telling Moment In the book I think it's my favorite part and it's not even in this
1:16:50
one it's in the audiobook and it's when it's getting quite difficult with your
1:16:55
mum and you offer her a root out you ask if she wants to take a break yup she
1:17:00
says no yeah I'm gonna keep going so it seems like she's got a bit of that dog in her as well oh yeah she had to
1:17:07
yeah she had to one thing that when you grow up the way we kind of grew up together so I look at it when you grow
1:17:14
up when she had she had 28 and my brother at 24. so um about that you know
1:17:22
we grew up together and you got to have a dog in you you have to have a dog in you man and so
1:17:28
you have to have it like my grandfather caught it a stiff upper lip you better have a stiff upper lip so you
1:17:35
know yeah she has some dog in her she has some dog in there she has to there's no other way to make it out here
1:17:41
I mean you can't just always be you know head down in the sand you gotta learn to pick yourself up on
1:17:48
your own a lot of times these fights and these battles you gotta be your own [ __ ] coach you gotta be your own motivator and she had to do that several
1:17:55
times in her life given all of this trauma that you go through why would you choose to go back and see
Why David Went Back to See His Tyrannical Father
1:18:01
this Tyrant of a father for one last time it was the only way for me to move forward
1:18:08
so like a lot of times if your back is hurting it may not be
1:18:13
your [ __ ] back it may be something else in your bias making your back hurt for me
1:18:19
I'm like man why can I get past this [ __ ] hurdle it's like I said I'm always examining
1:18:25
myself every day what is it what is it well there's only one thing you haven't
1:18:31
examined yet and it's going back to the Beast going back to the demon so when I went back to
1:18:37
him I realized that that was the unsolved mystery was I hadn't looked at man the eye one
1:18:44
more time like how I studied the that Navy SEAL talking [ __ ] and lying
1:18:50
I got it from this part right here in the book I went and I didn't see him anymore as
1:18:55
this Beast I started doing research on him found out that his dad used to beat him really
1:19:03
bad so my his dad would put him in front of a furnace open the furnace up with the Flames
1:19:10
coming out and put them right in front of it having bare butt naked
1:19:16
and he would whip the [ __ ] out of him and the whole idea of that is if you move you're going to get burned
1:19:22
so stay right here and take your [ __ ] beating so what happened with him
1:19:28
those demons from his father went to my father and he tried to transfer him over to me
1:19:34
I had to understand who my father was understand where he came from understand why were you so [ __ ] brutal to us
1:19:43
I got my answers took those answers it made myself better from the answers about him
1:19:50
and so that's why it was necessary for me to go back not I was looking for an apology
1:19:55
so then maybe I could just go be a loser and understand that you [ __ ] me up why would the apology make you a loser
1:20:02
it would make no it would make me feel Vindicated Justified yes like man you
1:20:08
you did this to me I can go be a loser now my failings are okay this okay yep because you did this
1:20:16
so I was looking for that and when I went there I I realized because this voice and he was saying it's not your
1:20:22
dad's fault and I'm like ah man because his voice over here always said it's your dad's
1:20:28
fault this other voice started tuning in was loud started getting louder the more I drove to Buffalo was saying
1:20:35
you get to face a lot of [ __ ] young man you got a long journey ahead of you because you're gonna find out that while
1:20:41
your dad did a lot of [ __ ] to you you're gonna have to [ __ ] make it on your own and the voice got louder and louder and
1:20:49
louder and by time I got to that door and by time I was leaving that house instead of me feeling sorry for myself
1:20:56
I started to doing live autopsy because a lot of people when you die
1:21:03
they figure out why you died they figure out how you died in the autopsy
1:21:08
but we never do a live autopsy to figure out why we're dying while we are alive
1:21:13
and I was dying I was living every day but I was really dead and so I figured it out and once I
1:21:20
figured it out I was able to reborn I was able to be reborn
1:21:26
what we see is this pattern of generational trauma your grandfather to
1:21:31
your father your father to you father to son just being passed on passed on passed on
1:21:36
is this part of your mission to be a circuit breaker to be a dam to stop this
1:21:44
Trauma from moving forward into the Next Generation 100 but with people I'm
1:21:50
trying to build people up I'm trying to armor their mind I'm trying to get them the belief because
1:21:56
this world we live in is tough it's tough it will beat you down the
1:22:01
world and the life that we live in is the ultimate competitor it will try to take you out it will it will find your
1:22:07
weakness and it will [ __ ] just Hammer you it's like a personal cause a hundred percent
1:22:13
so if I can help you build belief build confidence to the
1:22:19
point where nothing can hurt you because you know exactly who you are you've faced your
1:22:25
demons you've you've been able to go on an audiobook in your mind maybe you didn't
1:22:30
write a book but in your mind you were able to hear all your past traumas you're able to listen to them
1:22:36
you're able to [ __ ] say okay now I can now talk to people about what I went through I'm no longer embarrassed I'm no
1:22:43
longer ashamed being ashamed is one of the biggest things that kill people nowadays in their minds kill them from
1:22:49
moving forward I'm ashamed of myself don't ever be ashamed of anything you've done in your life face it fix it make it
1:22:56
better we are humans but then again if you always think that
1:23:02
we're humans you will always just be a human and always make the same [ __ ] mistakes
1:23:08
you must take this knowledge that you learned from all this [ __ ] is knowledge so I'm just trying to give people that
1:23:14
strength to go in the archives of your life because while you're probably [ __ ] up is
1:23:20
probably something happened to you in your life go through the archives dig it up study it
1:23:26
and then use it for yourself that's that's the main purpose for me right now have you considered what you would be
1:23:32
like as a father yeah I actually have a daughter right now
1:23:37
yeah no way I didn't know yeah I have a daughter right now but that
1:23:42
being said I'm an open honest person when you meet people at a young age so I
1:23:49
had a kid at a young age when I was in the worst possible place in my life so
1:23:55
when you're in a bad place you're not going to meet a Kish
1:24:01
you're going to meet a person that's very similar to who you are at that time and then you bring a child into this
1:24:08
world and as you start to move up in this world and get better and you realize I need to get better
1:24:14
you try to pull that person along with you a lot of times they don't want to come
1:24:20
where you're going and it creates a bad environment
1:24:25
so that's what that is right now talking about my daughter's 21 years old
1:24:30
though wow yeah I'm glad to hear that I think I I think that uh
1:24:36
it would be all of the learnings and stuff that you've been through as a father as a son
1:24:42
as a grandson um it makes sense to me that that would have been a
1:24:48
something that could have been passed out so thinking about uh trauma and stuff that you go through
Speaking up Against Bullying
1:24:55
in your past um it's um throughout most of school for me I was pretty isolated only child uh
1:25:01
pretty unpopular in school and the main issue that I had was it wasn't bullying it was isolation I
1:25:08
think it was being lonely right um and that was primarily what was causing me to be sad
1:25:15
throughout school right so I did this interview for the BBC about six months ago and uh in it I talk about
1:25:22
I haven't opened up that much about bullying and I need to do it more and it is you know even from watching you go
1:25:27
through opening up about your traumas is inspiring uh so I do this interview for the BBC and I mentioned a little bit
1:25:32
about bullying in school and so what I know as you mentioned it I haven't got around to it yet I I maybe
1:25:40
still feel like it detracts from the man that I want to be
1:25:46
the masculine man the um respected podcaster that it's somehow
1:25:51
undermines me as a person that it makes me weaker which is obviously what was you know part of the bullying's purpose
1:25:58
in school to be able to do precisely that right so I do this interview for the BBC and I mentioned in two
1:26:04
paragraphs or something but millions of people see this article uh and I get back one day and in my Instagram message
1:26:11
requests is this message from a guy and I kind of recognize his name but not not fully and I don't know whether you know
1:26:18
but there's like a character limit in Instagram so and this is five character
1:26:23
limit messages long with multiple paragraphs within each of them right so I open it up uh and this guy says uh hi
1:26:32
Chris you might not remember me but we went to school together uh I bullied you
1:26:38
my daughter is four and she's about to go to school and given that she's about
1:26:43
to go to school me and my wife have been discussing about the kind of child that we want her to be and that caused me to
1:26:48
reflect on my time that I spent in school I saw I've been thinking about messaging you for a while I've been considering
1:26:55
talking to you because I really felt like I needed to because I felt ashamed of the way that I treated you in school
1:27:01
and I knew that it had hurt you uh and then I saw this article from the BBC and I just had to reach out and
1:27:10
I've been sleepless nights speaking to the wife tears and all the rest of it uh
1:27:16
and that's why I just said I'm sorry I'm very sorry for what I did um I wanted to let you know that my
1:27:23
daughter is going to be raised in a way that will never treat anybody like that again
1:27:28
um I don't expect you to forgive me I don't even know if you'll see this message I'm happy to see that you seem
1:27:34
to be happy um but I needed to get it off my chest right
1:27:40
I'm like [ __ ] totally taken about it like wasn't prepared for this I have come back in from the gym or something
1:27:46
and I'm sat reading this message like [ __ ] hell that's heavy so I go back through and I think well how do I feel
1:27:52
about this how do I feel about this person how do I feel about my experience right um because it was so formative right
1:27:57
shaped so much of the way that I see myself the way that I see the world I had to deprogram
1:28:05
so much of the patterns that I'd learned right through that time
1:28:10
um my desire for validation from other people right my needs to be liked my
1:28:16
constant vigilance my ambient anxiety that was always looking for what was going on my concern of being laughed out
1:28:22
yep my adamant nature that everybody was um able to judge something about me that
1:28:28
I didn't know about myself yeah but this guy you'd like
1:28:33
fully fully opened up to me and I thought well you know it was beautiful it was a beautiful
1:28:39
message um so I replied to him and I said hey man um I'd very much appreciate you reaching
1:28:45
out I think it's an incredibly Brave thing to do and if
1:28:51
me going through what I went through and then the pain and discomfort and such
1:28:57
and your subsequent suffering of reflecting on what you did if that has led to a world in which your
1:29:05
daughter will be the sort of person who will behave in a manner that's going to make
1:29:11
the world a better place going forward I think that's a price that's worth paying that's awesome man
1:29:17
that's that's a great story that's a great story and you're the you're the expert on it
1:29:24
that's why you should talk about bullying I know yeah you're the expert and that's why I do it
1:29:31
you know um that's why I become I've I've become so vulnerable because all
1:29:37
that knowledge you gain because now you are successful and there's so many people who are
1:29:42
getting bullied in so many ways that you know you just show them that there's a path
1:29:49
but the path is really like I talk about studying the bully
1:29:55
that's the path studying the bully we have attempted to become a bully
1:30:02
never I'm always like I said like I told you before this started I wanted to be a priest I want to be a priest you know and uh
1:30:09
could you imagine one of those sermons oh it'd be sick because I would cuss because I would I would definitely cuss
1:30:15
praise the Lord [ __ ] that's it I would definitely cuss I would definitely cuss man because that's
1:30:21
that's the world and there's a lot of people if I hear this like oh my God that's this is oh my God let me close my hair
1:30:28
you know this the world's tough the world's tough
1:30:33
and when you come up the way I came up the only way I can [ __ ] describe
1:30:40
something sometimes is say [ __ ] a [ __ ] because that's how dark this [ __ ] was
1:30:46
and I can't make it flowery I can't make it PG like oh I want my kids to like I
1:30:53
have a clean edition of this book oh you have a non-explicit version yes because people like I want my I want my
1:30:59
kid to read your book but you but you cuss so much I can't I imagine it's about half the size yes it's very small
1:31:06
yes so so the funny thing about it is like how
1:31:11
long are you going to shelter your child from a world that's evil as [ __ ]
1:31:18
that's going to come at you it's going to come at you whether you've been bullied or not there's going to
1:31:23
come a time where it's going to come at you and it's gonna be a lot worse than [ __ ] or
1:31:29
[ __ ] it's gonna be a lot worse and so we are training kids and people
1:31:37
to be soft in a world that continuously gets harder
1:31:42
and it doesn't it doesn't correlate like that guy talking about the tear gas with the seals is that necessary
1:31:50
I don't know but what is necessary is you have to build a person that can
1:31:56
withstand the pressures of whatever they're going to be dealing with in life
1:32:02
and we don't do that I'm not trying to send a message of run 200 miles be the
1:32:08
best [ __ ] in the world but be tough you better have a part about you that's
1:32:14
tough a part about you that can break down situations and get better and break down situations very quickly
1:32:22
Within some trauma in your life some Devastation in your life because it's going to come the devastation the trauma
1:32:28
is going to come and you can't allow that to become a jersey barrier it can't be a jersey bear it has to be
1:32:34
something that you can maneuver through very quickly and move forward that takes a lot of toughness well
1:32:40
unchosen suffering is going to happen right so the only thing that you can do is have some shows and suffering to
1:32:46
prepare for it it's the only thing you can do that's the only thing you can practice for the unchosen suffering is
1:32:51
have chosen suffering do something that sucks every day I had human on the show a few months ago
What it Was Like Being Studied By Andrew Huberman
1:32:58
and he told me about bringing you into his lab and putting you in VR underwater with
1:33:05
sharks right give me your experience with huberman
1:33:10
he's great he he knows his stuff he knows his stuff
1:33:16
um yeah he's just a he's a very knowledgeable man on what he's doing what's being in VR with sharks like it's
1:33:23
nothing no no no because one thing about me is I deal in reality
1:33:28
you put me in vr's VR it's a fake thing
1:33:34
and I work in reality I only work in reality I don't work in fake situations so that's why I didn't
1:33:41
work on me you put me in a real ocean with real sharks you'll get your real reaction
1:33:48
you put me in a room that I when you walk in the door and you sit down in the chair and you
1:33:55
put some [ __ ] on your [ __ ] face I know I'm in a [ __ ] chair I know I'm in a room if you get that
1:34:01
Psych the [ __ ] out you need to study that more than that you know what I'm saying yeah why are
1:34:07
you so sensitive why are you so sick yes if you are on a high wire because you're afraid of heights but you're sitting
1:34:15
firmly on the [ __ ] ground you need to study the fact that you're doing something wrong
1:34:21
don't study the afraid of heights study why the [ __ ] do I know I'm on the [ __ ] ground in a [ __ ] chair but
1:34:27
I'm afraid of what's on this screen so I don't allow anything to go beyond
1:34:33
the truth he said that um obviously you didn't know this in advance it could have been the most
1:34:39
lifelike VR in the history of the world and apparently it was a group of you guys and someone had to go first someone
1:34:46
had to go first you're not that good with water not sure how you feel about sharks but can't imagine you're a fan
1:34:51
um and you were just like me me please yeah first yeah I'm like there with
1:34:58
everything because why sit back in the back and think about let me watch you go
1:35:04
first you can watch me go first is there anything that you'd like to study with heberman would there be any
1:35:11
like cool tests is there anything that you've been thinking about to do with performance or anything like that at the moment
1:35:17
no you've just got your own mental lab you're doing everything it's a lab every everything I need is in my mental lab
1:35:24
everything because I'm in constant study of myself that's and I know what needs to be
1:35:30
conquered because I'm constantly going through what I don't like what I'm not
1:35:36
comfortable with you know like I'm I know and only I can fix these problems
1:35:44
because I have to face these problems so I have a rolling
1:35:49
a rolling log of what needs to happen so I'm I'm really good at being accountable about okay
1:35:55
you need to be better here you need to be better here you need to overcome this overcome that and I do a good job of doing that you talk
1:36:02
about performance without a purpose what's that so like for instance let's say you have
1:36:09
no races let's say you have no classes no nothing you have there's no purpose
1:36:14
in your life you know people need to have purpose to get up they need purpose to perform
1:36:20
you need to get to a point in your life where there's nothing on the docket there is no 5K there's no there's no um
1:36:28
I'm gonna get into school to be this or that and still perform to the highest
1:36:33
level because what people don't get is one day that thing's gonna come up
1:36:39
and if you're not constantly performing without purpose you're not going to be
1:36:44
ready when a time comes it's this magical thing purpose that we're all looking for
1:36:49
but what's funny about it all is that we need these things to perform but we don't take a second to realize
1:36:56
the purpose is always there the purpose never leaves us because the very purpose is you
1:37:04
you are always the purpose there may be another purpose like being a seal or
1:37:09
going to college or whatever but the main purpose in life is you so if you wake up in the morning and you
1:37:16
don't want to do something you don't care enough about yourself and that's what you need to really
1:37:22
research is man why am I not doing this for myself because that is that is the
1:37:28
number one purpose in life is to better oneself so that's the only purpose I [ __ ]
1:37:35
need so the reason I give up every day even though there's no race or there's no school there's nothing in front of me
1:37:41
is because I have pride in myself but where do you go to you wake up on a
The Loneliness of Elite Performance
1:37:46
morning it's cold it's wet it's dark you've got no cartilage in your knee you've got shitty shots whatever it is
1:37:53
that's the issue today keep talking you've got these problems right I need
1:37:59
you to keep talking about what you were just saying it's warm on the couch your message says stay stay in bed it's comfy
1:38:05
it's cozy you've got work later on you had an argument last night you're slightly hungover because I know every
1:38:10
[ __ ] ain't gonna do what I'm gonna do so this is how you level up
1:38:16
that's how you level up I know there's a whole bunch of people with that right there that fires me up
1:38:23
that makes me [ __ ] happy which you just said that brings joy to my life right there why because I know there's
1:38:29
so many people that have the ability and just refuse to get off that couch
1:38:36
refuse to study a few more hours refuse to go deeper to go further and that's where I gained the advantage
1:38:44
it's so easy to be great nowadays my friend because most people are weak most people don't want to go to that
1:38:51
extra mile most people don't want to find that extra because it sucks it's miserable it's lonely you talk about
1:38:57
that you were kind of you know Lonely by yourself I was the same way
1:39:03
And That Used To Hurt Me growing up now I [ __ ] thrive in that [ __ ] that's
1:39:09
the only place to be well that was one of the things that is so surprising about
1:39:16
growing up through difficulty you know so loneliness is one example right growing up as a lonely kid
1:39:22
what you realize is a lot of the things that you feared or hated or embarrassed about as
1:39:28
a child end up being the Genesis of the things that you're most proud about as an adult so the fact that you can work and thrive
1:39:37
in solitude gives you the opportunity to be able to move to America and start a podcast or decide to do uh hell week
1:39:44
three times in a row or it doesn't matter how long or dark the courses you're just gonna stay
1:39:49
the fact that you were uh forced to be vigilant and to assess people to work
1:39:56
out what's going on when you became an adult allows you to detect the vibe and the energy of
1:40:02
whoever it is that you're speaking with and know that this person's someone that I want to hang with in this person somebody that I don't right all of the
1:40:08
things in fact I would go as far as to say there's not one thing in my life that I see as a
1:40:15
pure advantage that doesn't have a dark side to it that came about at some other point as well right so one of the
1:40:21
reasons that I spent so much time as a kid in my bedroom listening to audio tapes because I didn't have anyone to
1:40:28
play with right only child a little bit sort of unpopular so I'd be in my bedroom listening to audio tapes we go
1:40:34
to the library every two weeks and we take the tapes back and we get new tapes and I bring them and listen to them
1:40:40
again right but you roll the clock forward 20 years and what's the 2023
1:40:45
version of an audio tape it's a podcast podcast
1:40:50
a lot of the things that you love and value in yourself in adulthood are the light side of
1:40:57
something that you were ashamed fearful disgusted by when you were younger yeah I mean I think that comes from
1:41:03
overcoming a lot of people you know wonder how did you become this how do you become so
1:41:10
vulnerable how do you how are you doing a podcast now and you were this kid you overcame things
1:41:16
you fought them and now this is what happens this is on the other side of overcoming
1:41:22
it becomes you become very very powerful when you overcome yourself
1:41:28
all those things you once covered from you're afraid of when you face him eye to eye every day you know I become
1:41:35
a person who has a great podcast let's say that there's someone listening who resonates with what you're talking
1:41:42
about you know they've been through trauma they've been through hard times but they keep breaking promises to themselves and they're struggling to get
1:41:48
off the couch and they're having a pity party how can they stop feeling sorry for themselves
1:41:54
that's a difficult one because you have to want it
1:41:59
you have to want to be better and it starts off with you have to have pride in yourself
1:42:06
you you have to have pride in yourself you have to have there's something about you whether it's your last name whether
1:42:13
it's just the smallest thing you have to be proud of yourself if you
1:42:19
have no prior to yourself I can't give it to you because you're always going to compromise you're always going to fold always I'm very proud of myself that's
1:42:25
why when people said you know where you can do better than can't hurt me
1:42:31
Roger that we'll [ __ ] see it's that Pride that wakes you up now that's about
1:42:37
bad Pride I I'm a the attention to detail for the
1:42:42
human being I want to do I call this thing like I want to be the standard I want to be that guy like every place I
1:42:51
went in the military there was this ethos about how this place is how we're going
1:42:57
to live how we're going to represent ourselves and I walked around and I saw
1:43:03
that most people didn't live up to that ethos like if you go to
1:43:08
whatever whatever company they they had this mission statement on how we want to run our company
1:43:15
I made one for myself on how I want to be and that is why if people can make up a
1:43:23
mission statement in ethos in which they want to live by and every morning you wake up you hold
1:43:29
yourself accountable to that mission not a company is your own make up your own
1:43:35
mission statement what do you want to be in life and once you do that now you can
1:43:40
work with somebody to get better you can work with yourself to get better but until you know what you want to stand
1:43:46
for you will always just be sitting down you'll never stand for anything what's
1:43:52
that quote if you don't stand for uh something you'll fall for everything that's it it's a true statement
1:43:58
in the book you talk about uh Roger that there being two types of Roger that I
1:44:05
absolutely adore the second type uh received orders given expect results
1:44:13
that's it so cool above and beyond more than was expected that's right to the
1:44:18
ladder that's Roger that that is for me what Roger that means received orders
1:44:24
given yep expect results expect results that's right so [ __ ] dope that is it
1:44:30
that is it and when you hear that from somebody who gets it you know it because you can look in their eyes
1:44:36
you feel that energy man it connects immediately they're out here to get a job done Roger that
1:44:43
so it started the book or at least the start of the audiobook you've got a few
Being Friends with Joe Rogan & The Rock
1:44:48
different intros right uh Rogan yep your mum and The Rock right uh slightly odd
1:44:56
Trifecta but very I do think it works so obviously your time Rogan's had you on now the
1:45:02
third time that you've been on what have you learned since being friends with him he's a very singular individual you know
1:45:08
what one thing about him is that he's made it he's all about everybody else
1:45:13
making it there's one thing that he believes in is that there's enough food enough cake for
1:45:20
everybody out here to eat so there's a lot of people in this world who don't want to see you make it because they think you could take a
1:45:26
piece of their pie that motherfucker's like look dude pie for everybody I got 14 pies bro one
1:45:33
for every [ __ ] here and so he's all about people making it and that's something that a lot of us
1:45:40
can you know learn from that people think oh I made it I'm gonna hold on to it I'm not gonna help anybody
1:45:47
else out the thing is I don't even know if he was uh something tells me I had that philosophy before he'd even made it
1:45:53
yeah as he was on the come up yeah I mean I really didn't know him that much back then but um the
1:45:59
he really is to me the Oprah of the modern day
1:46:06
he's the open the modern day you know that that guy's just has made so many
1:46:11
people known to the world gotten so many messages out so yeah I
1:46:18
said uh I was talking to Andrew Schultz about the same thing and he said very similar sentiment especially he's coming
1:46:23
from a comedy uh angle right and if you're going to be championed in comedy
1:46:28
it's super super difficult right and what he what he said was that uh
1:46:34
the comedy world is so zero-some like your gig is not my gig that's right and the fact that you can have someone that
1:46:40
just gives that gift out is very rare another friend his wife does ayurvedic
1:46:45
medicine so it's I'm not really too sure what it is but she did something to do
1:46:50
with like tarot card reading okay and he asked her he was about to go on Rogan's
1:46:55
podcast so he asked her to do the tarot card readings about Joe because it might give him a little bit more insight or just be
1:47:01
interesting in general and the tarot card that she pulls out might not be Tara will be something similar the card
1:47:07
that she pulled out was um uh older Warrior cross-legged sat under a tree
1:47:14
with his hands like that this guy did it and he's got a weapon down next to him weapons laid down transcended the battle
1:47:20
and I was like holy [ __ ] it's like I'm not too sure I'm not too sure about what's going on with this tarot card
1:47:26
reading thing but that one seems pretty accurate it's probably perfect for him yeah yeah there's something about um
1:47:32
raising other people up as you go along oh yeah that you know as you get a platform as you have the opportunity to
1:47:39
expose other people that are almost all of your time as a podcaster is slip streaming of the people who have bigger
1:47:45
platforms and then after a while they get to this stage where you can be that springboard for others right some unbelievably talented person that nobody
1:47:52
knows about it there you go now the world can know about you he's done the
1:47:57
best at that he's the best at that what about the rock have you ever met him you ever trained with him never
1:48:03
never we just Damned and I was like I'm gonna give you a shot in the dark you
1:48:09
know the guy follows me he knows about me whatever I was like this guy's so big man ain't gonna [ __ ] it besides Deanna man but
1:48:17
then like 20 minutes hey man what's up brother sends me a voice message
1:48:23
in DM been following your work man love what you [ __ ] do blah blah blah blah
1:48:28
blah oh yeah no problem man I'll I'll hook you up I'll be more in honor to
1:48:33
hook you up and in the audiobook people don't know is I left them alone I was like hey man
1:48:38
thank you I appreciate it I want to bother you go back to doing the great work that you do you're so busy
1:48:45
so I was in the audiobook he was like Hey brother you want me to um you know read what I wrote for you for
1:48:50
the audiobook and I was like yeah that's great that's something I did
1:48:56
came about it was actually Rock's idea for him to do the blurb so then I got
1:49:01
Joe Rogan and I got my mom to read the blurbs so that came from him I wasn't gonna put the blurbs in the audiobook
1:49:07
but he was like hey man I got a studio right here I'll blast it out send it over to
1:49:14
you and we'll get it done that's a training session that the world wants to see
1:49:20
I believe so I believe so that should be part of the book tour it
1:49:25
could be a training a training session between you guys talk me through what the next phase of your life has in store
What’s Next for David?
1:49:32
um so after this podcast I probably won't do another one for a very long time and I did my
1:49:39
book came out on the sixth it's not the 16th I did my 10 days of the book and now it's done
1:49:45
and now it's going back to the lab so now I go back go back to firefighting
1:49:50
go back to finding another level of David Goggins and that's done
1:49:56
been quiet areas and finding more of myself finding these these spaces
1:50:02
haven't you know discovered yet my mind and I really love that about life I love
1:50:10
mastering self I love it I love it there's there's nothing more because I know where I came
1:50:17
from and it's amazing that where I came from that person could have died
1:50:23
that very fat lazy unfulfilled person and with
1:50:31
inside that person was this person talking to you is very freaky to me and
1:50:37
a lot of us have these two people that you have greatness way over here but you
1:50:44
decide to live in this space over here because between
1:50:50
greatness or between this space here and greatness there's a lot of [ __ ] work
1:50:56
there's so much space to fill in with work and we just say [ __ ] it
1:51:01
I'll just stay over here in this space so I like to [ __ ] examine all these
1:51:07
spaces and there's there's still more there's still more still a lot more
1:51:12
are you aiming to find peace at any point think about this I love that question I'm glad you I'm so
1:51:19
glad you asked it you know a little bit about me
1:51:25
when you've come from that place I talk about to the place I am now is not the peace you find
1:51:31
the peace I find and I find so much peace in looking back at that young
1:51:37
David eight years old with white spots on his face and stuttering in hair
1:51:43
patches falling out and I look at him like man there's so much peace in knowing what I
1:51:49
have accomplished and what I've done so my peace may be different for others
1:51:54
that's why I never critique or never judge anyone because I don't know your story where you come from I found peace
1:52:01
years ago years ago in the battle
1:52:07
in the battle you find peace when you go to war with yourself you find a lot of peace
1:52:12
because you know exactly who you are and that is where the piece has really found for me
1:52:20
David you're a spectacular individual I really really appreciate your time uh the book is fantastic your message is
1:52:25
